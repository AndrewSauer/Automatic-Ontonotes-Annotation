In the United States , a metropolitan statistical area ( MSA ) is a geographical region with a relatively high population density at its core and close economic ties throughout the area . 

Such regions are neither legally incorporated as a city or town would be , nor are they legal administrative divisions like counties or separate entities such as states ; because of this , the precise definition of any given metropolitan area can vary with the source . 

A typical metropolitan area is centered on a single large city that wields substantial influence over the region ( e.g. ,   New York City or Philadelphia ) . 

However , some metropolitan areas contain more than one large city with no single municipality holding a substantially dominant position ( e.g. ,   Dallas – Fort Worth metroplex , Norfolk - Virginia Beach ( Hampton Roads ) , Riverside – San Bernardino ( Inland Empire ) or Minneapolis – Saint Paul ( Twin Cities ) ) . 

MSAs are defined by the U.S. Office of Management and Budget ( OMB ) and used by the Census Bureau and other federal government agencies for statistical purposes .
