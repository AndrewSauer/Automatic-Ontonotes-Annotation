The Church of Saint Francis of Assisi is a Rococo Catholic church in Ouro Preto , Brazil . 

Its erection began in 1766 after a design by the Brazilian architect and sculptor Antônio Francisco Lisboa , otherwise known as Aleijadinho . 

Lisboa designed both the structure of the church and the carved decorations on the interior , which were only finished towards the end of the 19th century . 

The circular bell towers and the oculus closed by a relief were original features in religious architecture of that time in Brazil . 

The façade has a single entrance door under a soapstone frontispiece under a relief depicting Saint Francis receiving the stigmata . 

The interior is richly decorated with golden woodwork , statues and paintings , and the wooden ceiling displays a painting by Manuel da Costa Ataíde . 

Due to its architecture and historical significance regarding eighteenth century gold mining , this church is classified on the UNESCO World Heritage List .
