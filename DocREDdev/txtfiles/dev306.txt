" Steam " is the second single from English rock musician Peter Gabriel 's 1992 album Us . 

Gabriel has said that the song is about a relationship in which the woman is sophisticated , bright , cultured , and knows everything about anything and that the man knows nothing about anything , except , he does know about the woman , and she does n't know much about herself . 

In certain countries , " Steam " was more successful than Gabriel 's previous single , " Digging in the Dirt " , but in others , it was not . 

It reached number 10 on the UK Singles Chart , number 32 on the US Billboard Hot 100 , and number one on the US Modern Rock Tracks chart . 

Elsewhere , the song was a number - one hit in Canada , topping the RPM Top Singles chart for the issue dated February 27 , 1993 , knocking Whitney Houston 's massive hit " I Will Always Love You " off the top spot after a 10-week run . 

It was also a top 10 hit in New Zealand and Ireland , peaking at number seven in both countries . 

An alternative version of this song called " Quiet Steam " was a B - side on the " Digging in the Dirt " single . 

It is a very lo - fi take on the popular version that appeared on the album . 

On Secret World Live , " Steam " is preceded for a minute or so by the " Quiet Steam " version .
