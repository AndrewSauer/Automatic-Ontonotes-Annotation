" Teardrops " is a song by English rock musician George Harrison from his 1981 album Somewhere in England . 

It was also issued as the second single off the album , in July 1981 . 

As with the lead single , " All Those Years Ago " , Harrison completed the song after Warner Bros. Records had rejected his initial submission of Somewhere in England in September 1980 . 

In response to Warner 's concerns , he wrote " Teardrops " as an attempt at a commercially oriented song . 

Harrison recorded the song at his Friar Park studio in England with Ray Cooper as his co - producer . 

Despite some reviewers predicting it as a hit , the single failed to achieve commercial success . 

In the United States , it peaked at number 102 on Billboards Bubbling Under the Hot 100 chart and number 88 on the Cash Box Top 100 .
