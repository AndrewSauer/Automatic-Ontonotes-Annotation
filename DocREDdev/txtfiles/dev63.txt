The Loopline Bridge ( or the Liffey Viaduct ) is a railway bridge spanning the River Liffey and several streets in Dublin , Ireland . 

It joins rail services from south of Dublin to Connolly Station and lines north . 

Designed by John Chaloner Smith ( engineer to the Dublin , Wicklow and Wexford Railway ) , the bridge was built between 1889 and 1891 . 

It consists of wrought iron lattice girders on a double row of piers with five spans . 

The viaduct is approximately six metres above street level and supports two railway tracks . 

During original planning and construction ( in the late 19th century ) the project was subject to much opposition and controversy , because the structure blocks the view down river to The Custom House . 

However , the bridge was deemed necessary as a rail link between north and south Dublin , and to facilitate the movement of transatlantic mail coming from Kingstown ( Dún Laoghaire ) and Queenstown ( Cobh ) . 

100 years later , the visage of the bridge remains the subject of some debate . 

Already arguably less attractive than some of Dublin 's other bridges , the façades of the Loopline have been used by Iarnród Éireann for billboard advertising . 

, the company has scaled back the bridge 's use for this purpose to reduce impact on the city skyline , following input from An Bord Pleanála and Dublin City Council . 

A prominent feature in the city landscape since 1891 , the Loopline Bridge appears in one of the most famous literary works associated with Dublin :
