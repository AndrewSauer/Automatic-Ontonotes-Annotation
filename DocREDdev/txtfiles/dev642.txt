Operation Unified Resolve is an air and ground operation to flush out and trap al - Qaeda fighters hiding in the eastern Afghanistan provinces . 

Launched on 23 June 2003 , Operation Unified Resolve is a joint operation between Pakistan , United States , and Afghanistan . 

Over 500 troops , mostly from the U.S. 82nd Airborne Division , began hunting the Taliban and al - Qaeda fighters in the provinces of Nangarhar and Kunar on Afghanistan 's eastern border . 

The operation is especially focused on the city of Jalalabad , a known al - Qaeda stronghold strategically located on the main route between the Afghan capital Kabul and Pakistan city of Peshawar . 

Anti - coalition forces , led by former Afghan prime minister Gulbuddin Hekmatyar , have attacked coalition forces with their usual retinue of rockets , mines , and bobby traps . 

Hekmatyar has been organizing alliances between the remaining anti - coalition forces in the area and increasing their coordination . 

In addition to hunting the Taliban and al - Qaeda fighters , Operation Unified Resolve also distributes humanitarian assistance to the Afghan people in the nearby valleys .
