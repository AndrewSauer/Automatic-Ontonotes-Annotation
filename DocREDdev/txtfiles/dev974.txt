Mendenhall Glacier ( also Sitaantaagu ) is a glacier about long located in Mendenhall Valley , about from downtown Juneau in the southeast area of the U.S. state of Alaska . 

The glacier and surrounding landscape is protected as part of the Mendenhall Glacier Recreation Area , a federally designated unit of the Tongass National Forest . 

The Juneau Icefield Research Program has monitored the outlet glaciers of the Juneau Icefield since 1942 , including Mendenhall Glacier . 

The glacier has also retreated since 1929 , when Mendenhall Lake was created , and over since 1500 . 

The end of the glacier currently has a negative glacier mass balance and will continue to retreat in the foreseeable future . 

Given that average yearly temperatures are currently increasing , and the outlook is for this trend to continue , it is actually possible that the glacier might experience a period of stabilization or slight advance during its retreating march . 

This is because increasing amounts of warm , moist air will be carried up to the head of the icefield , where colder ambient temperatures will cause it to precipitate as snow . 

The increased amount of snow will feed the icefield , possibly enough to offset the continually increasing melting experienced at the glacier 's terminus . 

However , this interesting phenomenon will fade away if temperatures continue to climb , since the head of the glacier will no longer have cold enough ambient temperatures to cause snow to precipitate .
