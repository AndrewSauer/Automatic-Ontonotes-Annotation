The Sims class destroyers were built for the United States Navy , and commissioned in 1939 and 1940 . 

These twelve ships were the last United States destroyer class completed prior to the American entry into World War II . 

All Sims - class ships saw action in World War II , and seven survived the war . 

No ship of this class saw service after 1946 . 

They were built under the Second London Naval Treaty , in which the limit on destroyer standard displacement was lifted , but an overall limit remained . 

Thus , to maximize the number of destroyers and avoid developing an all - new design , the Sims class were only 70 tons larger as designed than previous destroyers . 

They are usually grouped with the 1500-ton classes and were the sixth destroyer class since production resumed with the Farragut class in 1932 . 

The class served extensively in World War II , and five of the class were lost in the war . 

Of the five ships lost , four were at the hands of the Japanese and one at the hands of the Germans . 

The class served on Neutrality Patrols in the Atlantic in 1940 - 41 . 

Except for Roe , Wainwright , and Buck , the class was transferred to the Pacific shortly after the attack on Pearl Harbor . 

All of the ships saw extensive combat service . 

At the war 's end in August 1945 , three of the seven survivors were undergoing overhauls that were left unfinished , and were ultimately scrapped . 

The remaining four seaworthy ships were used as targets during the 1946 Operation Crossroads atomic tests at Bikini Atoll . 

One was sunk by the first blast , while the other three were sunk as targets two years later after serving as experimental platforms .
