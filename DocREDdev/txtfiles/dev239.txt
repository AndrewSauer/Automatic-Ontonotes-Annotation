Edmund Burke (; 12 January [ NS ] 17309 July 1797 ) was an Irish statesman born in Dublin , as well as an author , orator , political theorist and philosopher , who after moving to London in 1750 served as a member of parliament ( MP ) between 1766 and 1794 in the House of Commons with the Whig Party . 

Burke was a proponent of underpinning virtues with manners in society and of the importance of religious institutions for the moral stability and good of the state . 

These views were expressed in his A Vindication of Natural Society . 

Burke criticized British treatment of the American colonies , including through its taxation policies . 

He also supported the rights of the colonists to resist metropolitan authority , though he opposed the attempt to achieve independence . 

Burke is remembered for his support for Catholic emancipation , the impeachment of Warren Hastings from the East India Company and for his staunch opposition to the French Revolution . 

In his Reflections on the Revolution in France , Burke asserted that the revolution was destroying the fabric of good society , traditional institutions of state and society and condemned the persecution of the Catholic Church that resulted from it . 

This led to his becoming the leading figure within the conservative faction of the Whig Party , which he dubbed the " Old Whigs " , as opposed to the pro - French Revolution " New Whigs " , led by Charles James Fox . 

In the nineteenth century , Burke was praised by both conservatives and liberals . 

Subsequently , in the twentieth century he became widely regarded as the philosophical founder of modern conservatism .
