Saint Malo (; also known as Maclou or Mac'h Low , or in Latin as Maclovius or Machutus , born 27 March 520 â€“ died 15 November 621 ) was a mid - sixth century founder of Saint - Malo , a commune in Brittany , France . 

He was one of the seven founding saints of Brittany . 

Saint Malo of Aleth was baptized as an adult by Saint Brendan the Navigator . 

He became a student of Saint Brendan . 

As a monk at Llancarfan Abbey in Wales , Saint Malo was known for his participation in the famous Voyage of Saint Brendan . 

As an Immigrant to Brittany , he helped in the missionary work of Saint Aaron of Brittany , was the first bishop of Aleth ( modern Saint - Servan , France ) and established churches in the area of Brittany now named Saint - Malo in his honor . 

Saint Malo of Aleth was later driven from the area to Saintes , France by opponents of his mission . 

Details of Malo 's career have been preserved in three medieval ' Lives ' that seem to include incidents associated with multiple people bearing a similar name . 

It appears that Saint Malo of Aleth was probably born in Wales in approximately 520 . 

Malo 's name may derive from the Old Breton machlou , a compound of mach " warrant , hostage " and lou ( or loh ) " brilliant , bright , beautiful " .
