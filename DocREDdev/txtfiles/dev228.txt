Emiliano Esono Michá is an Equatoguinean political activist currently imprisoned on weapons possession charges . 

His imprisonment drew protest from the US State Department and Amnesty International , the latter of which named him a prisoner of conscience . 

Michá was active with the Progress Party of Equatorial Guinea ( PPGE ) , a banned political party opposing the long - dominant Democratic Party of Equatorial Guinea . 

In late March 2008 , he was arrested without a warrant . 

Within a week , fellow PPGE activists Cruz Obiang Ebele , Gumersindo Ramírez Faustino , Juan Ecomo Ndong , Gerardo Angüe Mangue , and Bonifacio Nguema Ndong were also arrested . 

Michá was held for two months at the police station , turning which time he was allegedly tortured . 

In May 2008 , the six men were charged with knowledge of a weapons cache in the home of another PPGE activist , Saturnino Ncogo . 

Ncogo had died in prison on early March in suspicious circumstances . 

Authorities alleged he had thrown himself from the top bunk of his cell to commit suicide , but relatives received his body in an advanced state of decomposition , and no investigation was ever conducted . According to Amnesty International , the six men were given an unfair trial at which no evidence was presented save the weapons from Ncogo 's home and the statements the six had made under duress ; in addition , the six defendants alleged that police had altered their statements after the defendants had signed them . 

Despite being charged with unrelated crimes , the six were tried alongside Simon Mann , a UK national who had helped to organize a 2004 coup attempt . 

The six PPGE members were given sentences of one to five years apiece . 

The US State Department considers Michá a political prisoner , and has objected to his continued imprisonment . 

Amnesty International named him a prisoner of conscience , and has called for his immediate release .
