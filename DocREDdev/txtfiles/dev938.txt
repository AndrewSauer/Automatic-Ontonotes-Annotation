Pierre Le Gros ( 12 April 1666 â€“ 3 May 1719 ) was a French sculptor , active almost exclusively in Baroque Rome . 

Nowadays , his name is commonly written Legros , while he himself always signed as Le Gros ; he is frequently referred to either as ' the Younger ' or ' Pierre II ' to distinguish him from his father , Pierre Le Gros the Elder , who was also a sculptor . 

The " ardent drama " of his work and its Italian location make him more an Italian , than a French , sculptor . 

Despite being virtually unknown to the general public today , he was the pre - eminent sculptor in Rome for nearly two decades , until he was finally superseded at the end of his life by the more classicizing Camillo Rusconi .
