Silvan ( wood elves ) are a type of Elves in J.R.R. 

Tolkien 's fictional universe of Middle - earth , mainly the Elves of Mirkwood and Lothlórien . 

They are commonly known as Wood - elves . 

In the First Age the Elves of Ossiriand , or Laiquendi , were also referred to as wood - elves . 

Silvan Elves are mainly Nandor in descent but also mixed with Avari . 

Many of them were later ruled over by a small population of social elites who were Sindar ( Grey Elves ) or even Noldor ( High Elves ) . 

For example , Thranduil king of northern Mirkwood , as well as his son Legolas , were Sindarin Elves who ruled over a primarily Silvan population . 

Similarly Amdír and his son Amroth , the last Sindarin prince of Lorien , were Sindar . 

After Amroth was lost at sea , Galadriel and Celeborn came to rule over Lórien . 

Galadriel was a High Elf who belonged to the House of Finarfin , though she was actually of mixed Vanyar / Noldor / Telerin parentage , while Celeborn was also Sindarin ( Sindar being a subset of the Teleri ) . 

Silvan Elves are described as being less wise than other Eldar , and some of them are almost indistinguishable from the Avari , those who never joined the Great Journey .
