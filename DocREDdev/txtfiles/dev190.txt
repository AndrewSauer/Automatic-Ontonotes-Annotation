The Pleistocene coyote ( Canis latrans orcutti ) , also known as the Ice Age coyote , is an extinct subspecies of coyote that lived in western North America during the Late Pleistocene era . 

Most remains of the subspecies were found in southern California , though at least one was discovered in Idaho . 

It was part of a carnivore guild that included other canids like foxes , gray wolves , and dire wolves . 

Compared to their modern Holocene counterparts , Pleistocene coyotes were larger and more robust , weighing , likely in response to larger competitors and prey rather than Bergmann 's rule . 

Their skulls and jaws were significantly thicker and deeper than in modern coyotes , with a shorter and broader rostrum and wider carnassial ( denoting the large upper premolar and lower molar teeth of a carnivore , adapted for shearing flesh ) teeth . 

These adaptions allowed it to cope with higher levels of stress , when it killed larger prey , compared to modern coyotes . 

Pleistocene coyotes were also likely more specialized carnivores than their descendants , as their teeth were more adapted to shearing meat , showing fewer grinding surfaces which were better suited for processing vegetation . 

The lower jaw was also deeper , and the molars showed more signs of wear and breakage than modern populations , thus indicating that the animals consumed more bone than today . 

Behaviorally , it is likely to have been more social than the modern coyote , as its remains are the third most common in the La Brea Tar Pits , after dire wolves and sabre - toothed cats , both thought to be gregarious species . 

Their reduction in size occurred within 1,000 years of the occurrence of the Quaternary extinction event , when the climate changed and the majority of their larger prey became extinct . 

Furthermore , Pleistocene coyotes were unable to successfully exploit the big game hunting niche left vacant after the extinction of the dire wolf , as that gap was rapidly filled by gray wolves . 

These gray wolves are likely to have actively killed off the larger - bodied coyotes , with natural selection favoring the modern gracile morph . 

Human predation on the Pleistocene coyote 's dwindling prey base may have also impacted the animal 's change in morphology .
