Jonathan Sayeed ( born 20 March 1948 ) is a British politician who was a Conservative Member of Parliament in the United Kingdom from 1983 to 1992 and from 1997 to 2005 . 

He was the only member of the Conservative front bench who consistently , openly and publicly opposed the invasion of Iraq in 2003 . 

Even though he was reselected by the Mid Bedfordshire Conservative Association as the Conservative candidate to recontest his seat in the House of Commons shortly before the 2005 General Election , he was forced to retire by ill health . 

He was criticised by the Committee on Standards and Privileges for being " at the least negligent , at the worst careless " in respect of a company in which he had an interest but was completely cleared of any impropriety . 

In the investigation by Sir Thomas Legg into MPs expenses he was one of the minority of MPs who were completely cleared of any misuse of their second home allowances .
