In Christianity , worship is reverent honor and homage paid to God . 

In the New Testament various words are used for worship . 

The word proskuneo " to worship " means to bow down to God or kings . 

Throughout most of Christianity 's history , corporate Christian worship has been liturgical , characterized by prayers and hymns , with texts rooted in , or closely related to , the Scripture , particularly the Psalter ; this form of sacramental and ceremonial worship is still practiced by the Roman Catholic , Eastern Orthodox , and Anglican churches , as well as some Protestant denominations such as Lutheranism and Methodism . 

In Evangelicalism , worship is viewed like an act of adoration of God , with a more informal conception . 

The term liturgy is derived from the Greek leitourgia meaning " public service " and is formed by two words : " laos " ( people ) and " ergon " ( work ) , literally " work of the people " . 

Responsorial prayers are a series of petitions read or sung by a leader with responses made by the congregation . 

Set times for prayer during the day were established ( based substantially on Jewish models ) , and a festal cycle throughout the Church year governed the celebration of feasts and holy days pertaining to the events in the life of Jesus , the lives of the saints , and aspects of the Godhead . 

A great deal of emphasis was placed on the forms of worship , as they were seen in terms of the Latin phrase lex orandi , lex credendi ( " the rule of prayer is the rule of belief")â€”that is , the specifics of one 's worship express , teach , and govern the doctrinal beliefs of the community . 

According to this view , alterations in the patterns and content of worship would necessarily reflect a change in the faith itself . 

Each time a heresy arose in the Church , it was typically accompanied by a shift in worship for the heretical group . 

Orthodoxy in faith also meant orthodoxy in worship , and vice versa . 

Thus , unity in Christian worship was understood to be a fulfillment of Jesus ' words that the time was at hand when true worshipers would worship " in spirit and in truth " ( John 4:23 ) .
