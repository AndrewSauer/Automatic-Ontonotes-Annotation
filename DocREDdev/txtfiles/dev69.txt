" Achilles Last Stand " is a song by English rock group Led Zeppelin . 

Guitarist Jimmy Page and singer Robert Plant began writing it in the summer of 1975 and were influenced by Eastern music , mythology , and travels . 

At ten and a half minutes , it is one of the group 's longest studio recordings and one of their most complex , with different interwoven sections and multiple overdubbed guitar parts . 

It was released in March 1976 as the opening track for their seventh studio album , Presence . 

The song received positive reviews , with comparisons to other epic - style Led Zeppelin songs , such as " Kashmir " . 

Between 1977 and 1980 , it was a feature of the group 's concerts and a live performance from 1979 is included on the Led Zeppelin DVD ( 2003 ) . 

In several interviews , Page named it as his favourite Led Zeppelin piece and places his guitar solo on a par with " Stairway to Heaven " .
