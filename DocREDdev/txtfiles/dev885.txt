" Something to Believe In " is a power ballad by American Glam metal band Poison , being the 2nd single from their 1990 album Flesh & Blood . 

" Something to Believe In " was also released on the Best of Ballads & Blues album in 2003 , with alternate lyrics ( part 2 ) . 

The song peaked at number 4 in the US Billboard Hot 100 , number 5 on the Mainstream rock charts , number 35 in the UK and # 44 on the Australian charts . 

It was the last Top 10 on Billboard chart for the band to date . 

This song was dedicated to James Kimo Maano , a security guard and best friend of Bret Michaels who had died some time earlier . 

The cover art for the single depicts a tattoo on Michaels ' arm of a cross with the words " Something to Believe In " . 

The tattoo artist , according to Michaels , had been drinking and spelled " believe " incorrectly putting the " e " before the " i " . 

It was attempted to be corrected by adding a rose to the cross that covered the misspelling , but Michaels was never satisfied with the results . 

In the first season of the reality show Rock of Love , Michaels goes to a tattoo shop where the tattoo artist properly touches up the tattoo .
