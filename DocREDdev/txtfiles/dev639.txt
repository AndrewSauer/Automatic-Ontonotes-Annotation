Fingerpori is a Finnish comic strip written and drawn by Pertti Jarla . 

It started in Helsingin Sanomat in February 2007 , and is currently syndicated in Satakunnan Kansa , Aamulehti , Karjalainen , Keskisuomalainen , Turun Sanomat and Etelä - Saimaa . 

Several strip collections in album format have also been published . 

The main setting of the strip is Fingerpori , an imaginary Finnish small town . 

The main character in the strip is the eyeglass - wearing Heimo Vesa , but other citizens also appear , such as the brash - mouthed café worker Rivo - Riitta . 

As well as the Fingerpori residents , the strip has included characters such as the Pope , The Phantom , Spider - Man , Adolf Hitler , Kimi Räikkönen and Carl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim . 

A few strips , featuring Jesus , have caused controversy in some circles . 

The humour in Fingerpori is largely verbal and is often based on ( mostly untranslatable ) wordplay and puns . 

For instance , Vesa works at the multidisciplinary research center Fingerpoli , where " girls with pigtails " is a result of a bungled stem cell experiment . 

Jokes are often also based on allusions , such as recurrent jokes about the skull ring of The Phantom . 

Besides this , the strips often have an absurdist element . 

According to Jarla , his original vision for Fingerpori was to create a milieu of an " East German Duckburg " , but the current Fingerpori is more like a Finnish town still stuck to the 1970s as in Aki Kaurismäki 's films . 

Although Fingerpori contains some political satire , the author claims it is not a political comic strip .
