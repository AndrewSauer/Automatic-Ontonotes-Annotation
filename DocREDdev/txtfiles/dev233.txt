This is a list of United States ambassadors appointed by the 45th President of the United States , Donald Trump . 

Ambassadorships are often used as a form of political patronage to reward high - profile or important supporters of the President . 

The most visible ambassadorships are often distributed either in this way or to the President 's ideological or partisan confreres . 

Most ambassadorships , however , are assigned to Foreign Service Officers who have spent their career in the State Department . 

Regardless , all ambassadors must be formally appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate . 

While all ambassadors serve at the president 's pleasure and may be dismissed at any time , career diplomats usually serve tours of roughly three years before receiving a new assignment , and political appointees customarily tender their resignations upon the inauguration of a new president .
