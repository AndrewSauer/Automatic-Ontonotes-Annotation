Alice Bunker Stockham ( November 8 , 1833 in Cardington , Ohio â€“ December 3 , 1912 in Alhambra , California ) was an obstetrician and gynecologist from Chicago and the fifth woman to become a doctor in the United States . 

She promoted gender equality , dress reform , birth control , and male and female sexual fulfillment for successful marriages . 

A well - traveled and well - read person who counted among her friends Leo Tolstoy and Havelock Ellis , she also visited Sweden and from her trips to schools there she brought back the idea of teaching children domestic crafts , thus single - handedly establishing shop and home economics classes in the United States . 

Stockham lectured against the use of corsets by women , made public endorsements of the healthiness of masturbation for both men and women ( still controversial when echoed by U.S. 

Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders more than 100 years later ) , advocated complete abstinence from alcohol and tobacco , and believed in women 's rights . 

Stockham was very concerned with the economic plight of divorced women with children and prostitutes who wanted to get off the street . 

She felt that these women had no marketable skills and would be unable to support themselves , so she had copies of her book Tokology , a layperson 's guide to gynecology and midwifery , privately printed and gave them to " unfortunate women " to sell door - to - door in Chicago . 

Each copy came with a bound - in certificate signed by Stockham and entitling the bearer to a free gynecological exam . 

In 1905 , a then 72-year old Stockham and her publisher were convicted of circulating improper literature under the Comstock laws .
