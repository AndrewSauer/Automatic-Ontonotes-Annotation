The Private Life of Helen of Troy is a 1927 American silent film about Helen of Troy based on the 1925 novel of the same name by John Erskine , and adapted to screen by Gerald Duffy . 

The film was directed by Alexander Korda and starred María Corda as Helen , Lewis Stone as Menelaus , and Ricardo Cortez as Paris . 

Coming at the end of the silent film era , it was nominated for an Academy Award in 1929 , the year of the Awards ' inception , in the category of Best Title Writing . 

Duffy died on 25 June 1928 , and was the first person to be posthumously nominated for an Academy Award . 

That same year , the first " talkie " , The Jazz Singer , received an honorary award for introducing sound to film , and the category for which The Private Life of Helen of Troy was nominated was dropped by the second Academy Awards .
