The Neue Bachgesellschaft , or New Bach Society , is an organisation based in Leipzig , Germany , devoted to the music of the composer Johann Sebastian Bach . 

It was founded in 1900 as the successor to the Bach Gesellschaft , which between 1850 and 1900 produced a complete edition of Bach 's works , publishing many pieces for the first time . 

On completion of these collected works ( the Bach - Ausgabe ) , the original Society dissolved itself . 

The new Society approved three enduring projects : 

the annual edition of a Bach - Jahrbuch ( Bach yearbook ) 

biannual ( today : annual ) Bachfeste ( Bach festivals ) . 

The venues of the Bachfest have mainly been in Germany , but the 2012 Festival had an international dimension , being held in Görlitz - Zgorzelec on the German - Polish border . 

the founding of a Bach museum . 

In 1907 the Society opened the first museum dedicated to Bach at Eisenach , the town where he was born . 

This Bachhaus is managed by the Bachhaus Eisenach gemeinnützige GmbH , a registered charitable company , with the New Bach Society as its sole associate . 

The Society has not been directly involved in publishing scores in the way that its predecessor was . 

However , in 1950 it recommended that the second complete edition of Bach 's music be undertaken , the Neue Bach - Ausgabe ( NBA , in English : New Bach Edition ) . 

The project was a joint venture of musicologists in Göttingen , then West Germany , and Leipzig , then East Germany , in order to stress that the common cultural heritage was undivisible .
