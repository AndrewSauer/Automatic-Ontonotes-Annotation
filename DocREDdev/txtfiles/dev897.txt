The Piton des Neiges ( Snow Peak ) is a massive 3,069   m ( 10,069   ft ) shield volcano on Réunion , one of the French volcanic islands in the Mascarene Archipelago in the southwestern Indian Ocean . 

It is located about east of Madagascar . 

Piton des Neiges is the highest point on Réunion and is considered to be the highest point in the Indian Ocean . 

The volcano was formed by the Réunion hotspot and emerged from the sea about two million years ago . 

Now deeply eroded , the volcano has been inactive for 20,000   years and is surrounded by three massive crater valleys , the Cirques . 

Piton des Neiges forms the northwestern two thirds of Réunion , with the very active Piton de la Fournaise comprising the rest . 

As it name suggests , snow is occasionally seen on its summit in winter . 

The volcanic island is considered to be about three million years old ( Pliocene ) ; the other two islands in the archipelago , Mauritius and Rodrigues , are 7.8   million ( Miocene ) and 1 million ( Pleistocene ) years old , respectively . 

The island possesses a high endemism of flowering plants ( about 225 ) ; this has justified the creation of a biological reserve on the lower slopes of the Piton des Neiges .
