Liang Congjie (; 4 August 1932 â€“ 28 October 2010 ) was a Chinese historian best known for his work as an environmental activist who established the Friends of Nature in 1994 as the first environmental non - governmental organization to be officially recognized by the government of the People 's Republic of China . 

Liang 's father , architect Liang Sicheng , had led attempts to prevent the destruction of the walls surrounding Beijing with the land to be used for the construction of highways . 

His grandfather Liang Qichao spent 14 years in exile in Japan after he advocated on behalf of turning the Qing Dynasty into a constitutional monarchy . 

His ancestry came to haunt him during the Maoist Cultural Revolution when he was purged for his being the " grandson of China 's biggest royalist " . 

Liang was ultimately able to attend Peking University . 

Having learned about the activities of Greenpeace , Liang and three of his colleagues at the Academy for Chinese Culture came to agreement that a corresponding organization was required in China to address growing environmental concerns in that country . 

The group that they formed , Friends of Nature , eschewed Greenpeace 's more confrontational techniques , choosing to develop grassroots concern about nature through fostering environmental awareness in schools and establishing the nation 's first birdwatching group . 

The organization worked with the Chinese government to ensure enforcement of existing environmental law , including efforts to protect a Tibetan antelope which were on the path to extinction and videotaping the cutting stands of old - growth forest in Western China that led to a 1999 order by Zhu Rongji prohibiting cutting down such trees . 

Environmentalist Ma Jun described Liang as having " incubated the first generation of environmentalists in China " and described how he worked in conjunction with the government on a " constructively critical " basis to build support for protecting the environment . 

Friends of Nature 's Li Bo credited him with " promoting ordinary Chinese 's participation in supervising pollution problems and protecting the environment " . 

Liang was recognized in 2000 with the Ramon Magsaysay Award , which recognizes Asian contributions to public service , noting that he was able to push environmental issues while having " avoided the pitfall of alienating government " . 

Liang died at the age of 78 on October 28 , 2010 , due to a lung infection while at a hospital in Beijing . 

He was survived by his wife , a daughter and a son .
