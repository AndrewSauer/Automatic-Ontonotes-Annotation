The Pittsburgh Catholic is the weekly Catholic newspaper for the Roman Catholic Diocese of Pittsburgh , published for lay people and priests . 

It labels itself as the oldest Catholic newspaper in continuous publication . 

The newspaper was established in 1844 by Pittsburgh 's first bishop , Michael O'Connor . 

According to its website , the Catholic has a total market of 111,250 Catholics . 

The Catholic is available for free at most churches and Catholic outlets or centers in the Diocese of Pittsburgh , as churches purchase the newspaper in bulk for 21 cents per copy . 

Articles include news about events occurring throughout the diocese , articles on local diocesan schools , features on community and charity programs orchestrated by local Catholic organizations , reviews and commentary on contemporary media , question - and - answer forums by priests to explain church doctrine , and editorials on Church issues . 

The former Bishop of Pittsburgh , Donald Wuerl , was generally seen as a conservative bishop . 

As a result , the Pittsburgh Catholic is a conservative publication as well . 

However , because the newspaper is oriented towards the local region , it rarely contains extensive commentary on national issues . 

According to the Pittsburgh Business Times Book of Lists , the Pittsburgh Catholic is the largest weekly publication in western Pennsylvania and the second - largest newspaper in western Pennsylvania . 

The Pittsburgh Catholic is a member of the Catholic Press Association . 

Its general manager , Robert P. Lockwood , was nominated as finalist for the association 's annual St. Francis de Sales Award .
