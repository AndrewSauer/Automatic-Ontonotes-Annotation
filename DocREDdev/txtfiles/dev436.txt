The Waterloo Moraine is a landform and sediment body that was created as a moraine in the Regional Municipality of Waterloo , in Ontario , Canada . 

It covers a large portion of the cities of Waterloo and Kitchener and the township of Wilmot , and some parts of the townships of Wellesley and North Dumfries . 

About 90 % of the water supply of the Regional Municipality of Waterloo is derived from groundwater of the Waterloo Moraine aquifer system . 

During late 1989 and early 1990 , groundwater contamination in Elmira forced the Region to shut down some well fields . 

As a result , new land use management guidelines and water protection measures have been enacted . 

The Waterloo Moraine is the largest of fourteen moraines in the Region , spanning approximately 400 square kilometres . 

It is an interlobate moraine , consisting primarily of sand and gravel . 

It contains large aquifers , which discharge into the Grand River and its tributaries and maintain a base water flow rate into that system .
