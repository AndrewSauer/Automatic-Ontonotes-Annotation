Northern Territory Force was an Australian Army force responsible for protecting the Northern Territory during World War II . 

Most units assigned to the Northern Territory Force were based near Darwin and were responsible for defending the important naval and air bases in and around the town against a feared Japanese invasion . 

Northern Territory Force was briefly re - named the 12th Division in late 1942 but this was short - lived . 

Australian Army units were rotated through northern Australia during the war and six infantry brigades served as part of Northern Territory Force between 1942 and 1945 . 

The formation was reduced over the course of the war as the strategic situation in the Pacific turned in the Allies ' favour , although remnants remained until the end of the war . 

In early 1946 , it was converted back to the 7th Military District .
