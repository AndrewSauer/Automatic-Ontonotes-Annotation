" Lisa Mona Lisa " was the Austrian entry in the Eurovision Song Contest 1988 , performed in German by Wilfried . 

The song was performed twelfth on the night , following Germany 's Maxi & Chris Garden with " Lied für einen Freund " and preceding Denmark 's Kirsten & Søren with " Ka ' du se hva ' jeg sa ' ? " . 

At the close of voting , it had received no points , placing it last out of a field of 21 . 

The song is a ballad in which the singer likens the object of his affection to the Mona Lisa , in that she is very mysterious but nonetheless entrancing . 

The song was recorded in German , French and English . 

Due to the song 's poor performance , the English version was not released . 

It was succeeded as Austrian representative at the 1989 Contest by Thomas Forstner singing " Nur ein Lied " .
