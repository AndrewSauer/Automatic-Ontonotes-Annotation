New Haven Harbor is an inlet on the north side of Long Island Sound in the state of Connecticut in the United States . 

The harbor area is an inlet carved by the retreat of the glaciers during the last ice age approximately 13,000 years ago . 

The city of New Haven and its neighborhoods of City Point , Long Wharf , The Annex , and East Shore lie on the northern and eastern sides . 

West Haven is on the west . 

The Quinnipiac and Mill rivers converge and empty into the inlet on its north end . 

The Pearl Harbor Memorial Bridge crosses here . 

The West River empties into the western end of the harbor ( also known as West Haven Harbor ) . 

The harbor is protected from Long Island Sound by a peninsula on its eastern side , once known as " Little Necke " but now called Lighthouse Point , because of the lighthouse that was constructed on its tip in 1805 . 

The original lighthouse was replaced in 1845 by the current structure , called the Five Mile Point Lighthouse . 

This lighthouse was replaced for navigation in 1877 by the offshore Southwest Ledge Light . 

Sperry Lighthouse ( 1899 â€“ 1933 ) also served the harbor . 

In July 1779 , during the American Revolutionary War , the peninsula was the scene of an amphibious landing by British troops . 

The harbor is circumnavigable via the partially completed " Harborside Greenway " bicycle and pedestrian trail , which is part of the East Coast Greenway system .
