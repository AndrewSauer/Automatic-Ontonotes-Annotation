Latourell Falls is a waterfall along the Columbia River Gorge in the U.S. state of Oregon , within Guy W. Talbot State Park . 

The Historic Columbia River Highway passes nearby , and at certain locations the Lower falls are visible from the road . 

Near the base of the falls , a parking lot and path were erected to assist visitors to the site . 

Visitors must hike along the loop trail to see the upper falls . 

Latourell is unique among the best - known Columbia Gorge waterfalls , in the way that it drops straight down from an overhanging basalt cliff . 

Most of those falls ( even the famous Multnomah Falls ) tumble to some degree . 

Latourell Falls is an excellent example of columnar basalt formations .
