White Light Rock & Roll Review is Matthew Good 's second album as a solo artist , and was released on June 15 , 2004 . 

Though it was not as well - received as his previous solo effort , Avalanche , it quickly achieved Gold certification in Canada . 

Recording sessions for White Light Rock & Roll Review began less than a year after the release of Avalanche , making it the shortest time spent between records for Good . 

Having become disenchanted with the state of recorded music , Good became enamored with the techniques employed by classic artists like Led Zeppelin and The Who , who spent much of their careers perfecting their live shows and recording albums live off the floor . 

To this end , Good sought to write songs that could best be conveyed to live audiences . 

In fact , many of the record 's tracks ( including " Little Terror " , " North American for Life " , " Blue Skies Over Bad Lands " , " It 's Been A While Since I Was Your Man " , and " Ex - Pats of the Blue Mountain Symphony Orchestra " ) were written and performed live , well in advance of the album 's release .
