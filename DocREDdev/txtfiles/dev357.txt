The Battle of Sio , fought between December 1943 and March 1944 , was the break - out and pursuit phase of General Douglas MacArthur 's Huon Peninsula campaign , part of the New Guinea campaign of World War II . 

After the defeat of the Japanese in the Battle of Sattelberg , Australian Army forces broke through the Japanese positions around Finschhafen . 

Constant pressure from US Navy PT boats , Australian land forces and Allied aircraft brought the Japanese logistical system to the brink of collapse , resulting in disease , malnutrition , and privation for the Japanese soldiers . 

Meanwhile , the Allied supply system grappled with the problems of terrain and climate , particularly inclement weather and rough monsoonal seas that hampered and occasionally prevented delivery of supplies by sea . 

Australian and Papuan troops advanced along the coast of the Huon Peninsula , using infantry , tanks , and air strikes against the Japanese positions , which were generally sited at creek crossings in the jungle . 

The advancing infantry kept strictly within range of the supporting artillery , which was liberally employed in the early stages of the operation . 

Using tactics that exploited the firepower of Australian artillery and armour , the Australian and Papuan troops inflicted heavy and disproportionate casualties on the Japanese as they advanced , ultimately linking up with the American forces at Saidor . 

Hundreds of Japanese soldiers were killed ; thousands more died from disease , malnutrition , exhaustion and suicide . 

The Allies failed to seize the opportunity to completely destroy the Japanese forces . 

During the advance , Australian troops captured Japanese cryptographic materials . 

This had an important effect on the subsequent course of the war against Japan in the South West Pacific , as it permitted codebreakers in Australia and the United States to read Japanese Army messages on a much greater scale than previously .
