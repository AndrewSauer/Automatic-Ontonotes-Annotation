Tigran Vartanovich Petrosian ( June 17 , 1929   – August 13 , 1984 ) was a Soviet Armenian Grandmaster , and World Chess Champion from 1963 to 1969 . 

He was nicknamed " Iron Tigran " due to his almost impenetrable defensive playing style , which emphasised safety above all else . 

Petrosian was a Candidate for the World Championship on eight occasions ( 1953 , 1956 , 1959 , 1962 , 1971 , 1974 , 1977 and 1980 ) . 

He won the World Championship in 1963 ( against Mikhail Botvinnik ) , successfully defended it in 1966—against Boris Spassky — and lost it to Spassky in 1969 . 

Thus he was the defending World Champion or a World Championship Candidate in ten consecutive three - year cycles . 

He won the Soviet Championship four times ( 1959 , 1961 , 1969 , and 1975 ) . 

Petrosian is widely known for popularizing chess in Armenia .
