Estêvão Gomes , also known in the Spanish versions of his name as Estevan Gómez or Esteban Gómez ( Porto , Kingdom of Portugal , c. 1483 - Paraguay River , 1538 ) , was a Portuguese cartographer and explorer . 

He sailed at the service of Castile in the fleet of Ferdinand Magellan , but deserted the expedition before reaching the Strait of Magellan , and returned to Spain in May 1521 . 

In 1524 he explored present - day Nova Scotia sailing South along the Maine coast . 

While historical accounts vary , Gomes may have entered New York Harbor and seen the Hudson River . 

Because of his expedition , the 1529 Diogo Ribeiro world map outlines the East coast of North America almost perfectly .
