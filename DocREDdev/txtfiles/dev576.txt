Tullgarn Palace ( ) is a royal summer palace in the province of SÃ¶dermanland , south of Stockholm , Sweden . 

Built in the 1720s , the palace offers a mixture of rococo , Gustavian and Victorian styles . 

The interior design is regarded as one of Sweden 's finest . 

Tullgarn Palace is mainly associated with King Gustaf V and Queen Victoria , who spent their summers here at the end of the 19th century and beginning of the 20th century . 

However , the palace was originally built for Duke Fredrik Adolf in the 1770s . 

Since Tullgarn was a popular summer palace amongst Swedish royalty , the palace houses fine examples of interiors from different epochs and personal styles , such as the small drawing room , decorated in the 1790s , the breakfast room in southern German Renaissance style from the 1890s and Gustav V 's cigar room , which has remained largely untouched since his death in 1950 .
