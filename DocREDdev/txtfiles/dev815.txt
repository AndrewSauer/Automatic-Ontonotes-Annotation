The Treaty of Ghent ( ) was the peace treaty that ended the War of 1812 between the United States of America and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland . 

Both sides signed it on December 24 , 1814 , in the city of Ghent , United Netherlands . 

The treaty restored relations between the two nations to status quo ante bellum , restoring the borders of the two countries to the lines before the war started in June 1812 . 

The treaty was approved by the UK parliament and signed into law by the Prince Regent ( the future King George IV ) on December 30 , 1814 . 

It took a month for news of the peace treaty to reach the United States , and in the meantime American forces under Andrew Jackson won the Battle of New Orleans on January 8 , 1815 . 

The Treaty of Ghent was not fully in effect until it was ratified by the U.S. Senate unanimously on February 17 , 1815 . 

It began two centuries and more of peaceful relations between the U.S. and Britain , although there were a few tense moments such as the Trent Affair in 1861 .
