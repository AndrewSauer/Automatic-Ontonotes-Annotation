The Overseas Press Club of America ( OPC ) was founded in 1939 in New York City by a group of foreign correspondents . 

The wire service reporter Carol Weld was a founding member , as was war correspondent Peggy Hull . 

The club seeks to maintain an international association of journalists working in the United States and abroad , to encourage the highest standards of professional integrity and skill in the reporting of news , to help educate a new generation of journalists , to contribute to the freedom and independence of journalists and the press throughout the world , and to work toward better communication and understanding among people . 

The organization has approximately 500 members who are media industry leaders . 

Every April , the OPC holds a dinner to award excellence in journalism for the previous year . 

The awards are juried by industry peers . 

The organization also has a foundation that distributes scholarships to college students who want to begin a career as a foreign correspondent . 

Many scholarship winners secure international assignments at some of the most prestigious news outlets in the world . 

In April 2008 , the OPC relaunched its website to include community features for members like forums , commenting , page sharing through email / print / download and RSVP and bill pay functions .
