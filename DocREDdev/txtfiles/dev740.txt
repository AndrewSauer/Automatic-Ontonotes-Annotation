ENASA ( Empresa Nacional de Autocamiones S.A. ) was a Spanish vehicle manufacturing company , incorporated in 1946 having bought the automotive assets of the Spanish arm of Hispano - Suiza . 

It produced trucks , buses and military armored vehicles under the Pegaso and , for a short while , Sava brands . 

Enasa belonged to the state - owned INI industrial holding . 

From 1983 Enasa also owned Seddon Atkinson , which it received from International Harvester as compensation for a planned engine plant which had failed to materialize . 

International Harvester pulled out as the market for truck engines was contracting at the time , while there were also problems with Spain 's admittance to the European Economic Community ( EEC ) . 

In 1990 Enasa was sold to Iveco .
