The Irish Experiment is the popular name for the interest , primarily from VFL / AFL clubs , in bringing Irish Gaelic footballers over to Australia to play Australian rules football professionally . 

The AFL 's focus on Gaelic footballers is due to the similarities between the sports . 

The Irish Experiment began in the mid-1980s as an informal project of the Melbourne Football Club . 

Despite its initial success , enthusiasm for the project lapsed until the 2000s , when it again became ongoing and currently increasing due to globalisation and professionalism in sport . 

The highest profile product of the experiment to date has been Medal of the Order of Australia and Brownlow Medal recipient Jim Stynes , who was an early recruit . 

Irishman Tadhg Kennelly was a key player in the Sydney Swans 2005 AFL Grand Final victory . 

The highest profile Gaelic footballer to sign an AFL contract is Tommy Walsh . 

Over the years the Irish experiment has attracted media and public interest in both Ireland and Australia .
