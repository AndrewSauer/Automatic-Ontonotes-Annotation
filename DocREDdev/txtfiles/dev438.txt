The Virgin and Child with St Anne and St John the Baptist , sometimes called The Burlington House Cartoon , is a drawing by Leonardo da Vinci . 

The drawing is in charcoal and black and white chalk , on eight sheets of paper glued together . 

Because of its large size and format the drawing is presumed to be a cartoon for a painting . 

No painting by Leonardo exists that is based directly on this cartoon . 

The drawing depicts the Virgin Mary seated on the knees of her mother , St Anne , while holding the Child Jesus as Jesus ' young cousin , St. John the Baptist , stands to the right . 

It currently hangs in the National Gallery in London . 

It was either executed in around 1499 – 1500 , at the end of the artist 's first Milanese period , or around 1506 – 1508 , when he was shuttling between Florence and Milan . 

The majority of scholars prefer the latter date , although the National Gallery and others prefer the former .
