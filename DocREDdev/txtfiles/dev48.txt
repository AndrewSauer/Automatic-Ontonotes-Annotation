CBBC ( short for Children 's BBC ) is a British children 's television strand owned by the BBC and aimed for children aged from 6 to 12 . 

BBC programming aimed at under six year old children is broadcast on the CBeebies channel . 

CBBC broadcasts from 7   am to 9   pm on the digital CBBC Channel , available on most UK digital platforms . 

The CBBC brand was used for the broadcast of children 's programmes on BBC One on weekday afternoons and on BBC Two mornings until these strands were phased out in 2012 and 2013 respectively , as part of the BBC 's " Delivering Quality First " cost - cutting initiative . 

CBBC programmes were also broadcast in high definition alongside other BBC content on BBC HD , generally at afternoons on weekends , unless the channel was covering other events . 

This ended when BBC HD closed on 26 March 2013 , but CBBC HD launched on 10 December 2013 . 

BBC - produced children 's programming , in native languages of Scotland and Wales , also airs on BBC Alba and S4C respectively .
