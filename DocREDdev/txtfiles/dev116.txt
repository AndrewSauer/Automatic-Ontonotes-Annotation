On June 19 , 2007 , the Vatican , under the direction of Pope Benedict XVI and Cardinal Renato Martino , issued a 36-page document entitled Guidelines for the Pastoral Care of the Road , created by the curial Pontifical Council for Migrants and Itinerant People , under the leadership of Renato Raffaele Cardinal Martino , and intended for bishop conferences around the world . 

The document specifically states that it is aimed at bishops , priests , religious and other pastoral workers in hopes of pastoral caregivers paying greater attention to expressions of human mobility . 

The document derived some of its material from the Old Testament , the New Testament , the American Automobile Association , and statements by Popes Pius XII , John XXIII , Paul VI and John Paul II . 

On its issue this document received a lot of media attention due to its listing of Ten Commandments for Drivers . 

In essence , the Vatican is pointing out that the act of driving has a moral and ethical component . 

The Guidelines make note of both the benefits of the use of automobiles as well as its dangerous and negative consequences . 

The problem is not as pervasive in the Vatican City itself , which has a speed limit of 30   km / h ( 18 - 19   mph ) and approximately only 1000 cars ; but there were over 35 million deaths resulting from car accidents in the 20th century , and the Vatican is responding . 

In the same section of the document as the Drivers ' Ten Commandments are the so - called Christian virtues of drivers , which include prudence , justice and hope . 

The Guidelines not only deal with problems on the road , but also address prostitution , caring for street children and the homeless , found in Parts Two , Three and Four of the Guidelines . 

The Guidelines state that driving can bring out primitive behavior in drivers , which leads to road rage , rude gestures , speeding , drinking behind the wheel , cursing , blasphemy , impoliteness , and intentional violation of the highway code . 

The Guidelines encourage drivers to obey the highway code , pray behind the wheel and recite the rosary , which the Guidelines insist would not distract the driver 's attention .
