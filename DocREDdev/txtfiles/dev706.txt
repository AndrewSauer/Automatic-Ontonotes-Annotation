Granskär ( , ) is an island in the Kvarken ( " The Throat " ) , the narrowest part of the Gulf of Bothnia in the northern part of the Baltic sea . 

It has few inhabitants , almost all Swedish - speaking . 

Granskär belongs to the municipality of Vaasa . 

The area has been inhabited since before the time of Swedish dominion over Finland ; the first habitations can be traced to at least the 11th century and possibly earlier . 

Granskär is part of a larger archipelago and most of the smaller islands around Replot have traditionally been used as fishing camps . 

Today the buildings are generally used as summer cottages since maritime activities play a large part in the culture of the region . 

Fishing is nowadays mostly a recreational activity , but there are still a number of professional fishermen active in the archipelago . 

A large part of the Kvarken archipelago has been designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site .
