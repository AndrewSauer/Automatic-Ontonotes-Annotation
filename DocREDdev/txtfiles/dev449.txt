This is a list of Presidents of Ethiopia and also a list of heads of state after the fall of the Ethiopian Empire in 1974 . 

Until 1974 , the heads of state of the Ethiopian Empire were either Emperors or regents . 

From the coup d'état of the Derg leading to the fall of the Empire in September 1974 until March 1975 , the Derg considered the Crown Prince Asfaw Wossen as the nominal head of state – which the Crown Prince refused to accept . 

During this time , the Chairmen of the Derg , the leaders of the Derg , were to be considered as acting heads of state . 

After 21 March 1975 , the Derg military junta fully took over . 

Until the establishment of the People 's Democratic Republic of Ethiopia in 1987 , still dominated by Derg figures , Chairmen of the Derg have to be considered heads of state – but not presidents . 

After the fall of the Derg and the establishment of the Transitional Government of Ethiopia in 1991 , the first immediate President ( Meles Zenawi ) has to be considered an Interim President . 

Since the formal establishment of the office of President in 1987 , there have been 6 official presidents . 

The President is the head of state of Ethiopia . 

The current president is Sahle - Work Zewde , who is also the first female president of Ethiopia , elected on 25 October 2018 by members of the Federal Parliamentary Assembly .
