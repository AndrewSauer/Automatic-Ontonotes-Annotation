Zevs ( born Christophe Aguirre Schwarz on 17 November 1977 in Saverne , France ) is a French street artist , best known for his trademark " liquidation " technique . 

He was an early and influential graffiti artist and active as a tagger in Paris in the 1990s . 

He is named after a regional train , Zeus , that almost ran him over one day he was down in the metro . 

Working with other French artists in the second half of the 1990s like André and Invader , Zevs has been among the prominent figures who pioneered the French street art scene . 

By the end of the 1990s he became known for his poetic drawings of shadows in Paris , shortly after the departure of Facundo Newbery from Paris . 

Later he ' bombed ' models on the billboards between the eyes . 

Though his interventions have been very popular , it has been discussed in France whether it is vandalism or art . 

In 2008 Zevs had his first major survey exhibition at the classical art museum the Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek in Copenhagen , Denmark . 

His work , including selections of all of his major series to that point , was displayed alongside masterpieces in the museum 's permanent collections such as Édouard Manet 's The Absinthe Drinker and Auguste Rodin 's The Thinker .
