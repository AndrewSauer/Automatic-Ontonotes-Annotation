Abdul Jabar Sabet is an Afghan politician . 

In May 2006 Hamid Karzai appointed him Attorney General of Afghanistan . 

Sabet is an ethnic Pashtun . 

Sabet was a long time aide to former Afghan Prime Minister Gulbuddin Hekmatyar . 

After leaving Afghanistan , he worked in the U.S. for Voice of America . 

After living in Montreal , Sabet returned to Afghanistan to work for a human rights organization , before being appointed special adviser at the Interior Ministry . 

He was promoted to Attorney General in May 2006 . 

Sources close to the President Hamid Karzai say that Sabet was promoted with U.S. support in exchange for giving positive comments about the Guantanamo Bay detention facility . 

He has however been critical of the Guantanamo release policy . 

A series of articles on former Guantanamo captives , published by the McClatchy News Service , quoted Sabet commenting that the release of Guantanamo captives seemed to be divorced from the captives ' role in the Taliban , and to be focussed largely on whether the captives complied with the camp rules . 

In April 2007 , Sabet launched a violent raid on Tolo TV ( the country 's largest private TV chain ) for what he thought was a " distorted " report on his comments regarding the country 's judicial system . 

Seven journalists from the TV station were taken to his office by force without warrants and severely beaten .
