Regal Mountain is an eroded stratovolcano or shield volcano in the Wrangell Mountains of eastern Alaska . 

It is located in Wrangell - Saint Elias National Park about east of Mount Blackburn , the second highest volcano in the United States , and southeast of the massive Nabesna Glacier . 

Regal Mountain is the third highest thirteener ( a peak between 13,000 and 13,999 feet in elevation ) in Alaska , ranking just behind its neighbor , Atna Peaks . 

Because the mountain is almost entirely covered in glaciers , no geological studies have been done , but published references state and the geological map shows that the mountain is an old eroded volcanic edifice . 

Several major glaciers flow from the steep and heavily eroded flanks of Regal Mountain . 

The Rohn Glacier and Regal Glacier head east and southeast to join the Nizina Glacier , while the Root Glacier flows south to join the Kennicott Glacier just above the town of McCarthy . 

Each of those large glaciers exceeds in width , but largest of all on Regal Mountain is a massive unnamed glacier , over across , which flows northwest just over to join the mighty Nabesna .
