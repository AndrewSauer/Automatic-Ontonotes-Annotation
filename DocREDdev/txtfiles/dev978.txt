Guybrush Ulysses Threepwood is the main protagonist of the Monkey Island series of computer adventure games by LucasArts . 

Guybrush is voiced by actor Dominic Armato in the third , fourth and fifth games , as well as the enhanced remakes of The Secret of Monkey Island and . 

Though a " mighty pirate " by his own account , it is a running joke throughout the games for characters to garble Guybrush Threepwood 's unusual name , either deliberately or accidentally . 

The origin of the name " Guybrush " comes in part from Deluxe Paint , the tool used by the artists to create the character sprite . 

Since the character had no name at this point , the file was simply called ' Guy ' . 

When the file was saved , Steve Purcell , the artist responsible for the sprite , added ' brush ' to the filename , indicating that it was the Deluxe Paint " brush file " for the " Guy " sprite . 

The file name was then " guybrush.bbm " , so the developers eventually just started referring to this unnamed ' Guy ' as " Guybrush " . 

Guybrush 's surname " Threepwood " was decided upon in a company contest and is derived from P. G. Wodehouse 's family of characters including Galahad Threepwood and Freddie Threepwood ( with whom he shares similar characteristics ) . 

" Threepwood " is also rumoured to have been the name of Dave Grossman 's RPG character .
