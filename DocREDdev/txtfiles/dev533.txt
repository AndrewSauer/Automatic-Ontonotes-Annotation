Battle of Samugarh , Jang - e - Samugarh , ( May 29 , 1658 ) , was a decisive battle in the struggle for the throne during the Mughal war of succession ( 1658 – 1659 ) between the sons of the Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan after the emperor 's serious illness in September 1657 . 

The battle of Samugarh was fought between his sons Dara Shikoh ( the eldest son and heir apparent ) and his two younger brothers Aurangzeb and Murad Baksh ( third and fourth sons of the Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan ) . 

Dara Shikoh began to retreat towards Samugarh , about 10 miles ( 16   km ) east of Agra , India , south of the Yamuna River , after Aurangzeb had defeated Dara Shikoh 's forces during the Battle of Dharmat . 

Aurangzeb and his smaller but formidable army then flanked Dara ’s fortified line along the Chambal River by finding a little - known and unguarded ford . 

The battle was fought during northern India 's warmest season and Aurangzeb 's men were on the march for a very long while . 

The army of Aurangzeb arrived with yellow banners and flags and fortified their position in front of the heir apparent . 

Dara Shikoh then tried to protect his rear flank by erecting massive red tents and banners .
