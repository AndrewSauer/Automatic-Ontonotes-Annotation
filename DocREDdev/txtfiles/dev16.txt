Johan Gottlieb Gahn ( 19 August 1745 – 8 December 1818 ) was a Swedish chemist and metallurgist who discovered manganese in 1774 . 

Gahn studied in Uppsala 1762 – 1770 and became acquainted with chemists Torbern Bergman and Carl Wilhelm Scheele . 

1770 he settled in Falun , where he introduced improvements in copper smelting , and participated in building up several factories , including those for vitriol , sulfur and red paint . 

He was the chemist for The Swedish Board of Mines Bergskollegium from 1773 – 1817 . 

Gahn was however very reluctant to publish his scientific findings himself , but freely communicated them to Bergman and Scheele . 

One of Gahn 's discoveries was that manganese dioxide could be reduced to manganese metal using carbon , becoming the first to isolate this element in its metal form . 

In 1784 , Gahn was elected a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences . 

He also made a managerial career in Swedish mining .
