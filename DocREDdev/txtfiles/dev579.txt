Cine - Allianz Tonfilm was a German film production company established in 1932 by Arnold Pressburger and Gregor Rabinovitch . 

The company specalised in co - productions targeted at international markets , and enjoyed immediate success during the final year of the Weimar Republic . 

During the Nazi era the company 's Jewish owners came under increasing pressure from the government and their property was expropriated . 

They were forced into exile , while Cine - Allianz continued to produce films under the Nazi regime until its merger with UFA in 1942 . 

Rabinovitch went into exile in France where he set up a fresh production company also named Cine - Allianz which produced films such as I Was an Adventuress ( 1938 ) . 

The 1951 film The Lost One was partly financed by money received as post - war compensation for the loss of Cine - Allianz .
