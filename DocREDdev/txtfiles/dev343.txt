" My Red Hot Car " is a single by Squarepusher , released in 2001 on Warp Records . 

The lead track on the single is " My Red Hot Car ( Girl ) " , which leaves the pop music aspects of the song intact . 

An extended version of " My Red Hot Car " is featured on the album Go Plastic . 

My Red Hot Car is notable for two different hidden tracks , based on format : the CD version features an ambient piece after 23 minutes of silence , while the vinyl features a percussion - less version of " I Wish You Obelisk " presented behind a silent , locked groove , meaning the needle must be lifted halfway through the second side and placed after the locked groove in order to hear it . 

The single was selected as NME Single of the Week in its week of release .
