Starin 's Glen Island was a summer resort in the community of New Rochelle in Westchester County , New York , developed by shipping magnate and U.S. 

Congressman John H. Starin in the late 1800s . 

Starin 's resort , referred to as " America 's pleasure grounds " and " Disneyworld on the Sound " , was the first theme park in the country . 

The park 's original design exhibited the five cultures of the western world on individual islands linked together with piers and causeways . 

The extreme popularity of the park resulted in a building boom in New Rochelle in the first decade of the twentieth century . 

The resort was located on Glen Island , in New Rochelle 's Lower Harbor , just off of Long Island Sound . 

The island is situated between Davids ' , Neptune , and Travers Islands in New Rochelle , and Hunter Island in nearby Pelham Bay Park , in the Bronx borough of New York City . 

Although now one island , the site originally consisted of one large main island in close proximity to at least four smaller nearby islands , a number of rocky outcroppings , low - lying flats , and salt marshes . 

The site is currently occupied by the county 's Glen Island Park , which includes remnants of some of the historic structures .
