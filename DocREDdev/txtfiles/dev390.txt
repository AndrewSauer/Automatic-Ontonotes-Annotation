The Orange Grove affair was a political scandal in Australia concerning the dealings of the New South Wales state Australian Labor Party government with multinational corporation The Westfield Group . 

It resulted from a court decision in 2004 to force the closure of the Orange Grove shopping centre after a zoning dispute , with the loss of approximately 200 jobs . 

Westfield , who owned a nearby shopping centre , had challenged the legitimacy of the Orange Grove centre , which was operating on land not zoned for this purpose . 

When the courts ruled in Westfield 's favor , Liverpool City Council sought State Government approval for a retrospective rezoning , to validate its earlier decision to approve the shopping centre . 

The State Government declined to intervene , despite a planning report suggesting that course of action , and the retail component of the Orange Grove centre was forced to close . 

The bulky goods component of the centre remained open , as the centre was legally zoned for bulky goods sales . 

However , the state Opposition subsequently unearthed information about a meeting between Premier Bob Carr 's chief of staff and a prominent Westfield employee , sparking allegations that interference from Westfield had played a role in the government 's decision not to intervene . 

As a result , a parliamentary inquiry was commissioned , and the Independent Commission Against Corruption announced an investigation . 

The investigation concluded in 2005 , with no findings of corruption against any person . 

However , the Commission recommended that the NSW Government strengthen guidelines for public servants dealing with corruption allegations by lobbyists . 

Unlike Nick Greiner in 1992 and Barry O'Farrell in 2014 , the Orange Grove affair marked the only time that a sitting Premier in Bob Â  Carr had survived appearing before ICAC although Carr did retire mere months after the conclusion of ICAC 's investigation of the Orange Grove affair .
