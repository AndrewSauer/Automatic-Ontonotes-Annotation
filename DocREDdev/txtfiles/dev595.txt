Cleopatra 's Needle is the popular name for each of three Ancient Egyptian obelisks re - erected in London , Paris , and New York City during the nineteenth century . 

The obelisks in London and New York are a pair ; the one in Paris is also part of a pair originally from a different site in Luxor , where its twin remains . 

Although all three needles are genuine Ancient Egyptian obelisks , their shared nickname is a misnomer , as they have no connection with the Ptolemaic Queen Cleopatra VII of Egypt and were already over a thousand years old in her lifetime . 

The London and New York needles were originally made during the reign of the 18th Dynasty Pharaoh Thutmose III . 

The Paris needle dates to the reign of the 19th Dynasty Pharaoh Ramesses II , and was the first to be moved and re - erected . 

The New York needle was the first to acquire the French nickname , " L'aiguille de Cléopâtre " , when it stood in Alexandria .
