The Battle of Chiari was fought on 1 September 1701 during the War of the Spanish Succession . 

The engagement was part of Prince Eugene of Savoy 's campaign to seize the Spanish controlled Duchy of Milan in the Italian peninsula , and had followed his victory over Marshal Catinat at the Battle of Carpi in July . 

Marshal Villeroi replaced Catinat as commander of the Franco – Spanish – Savoyard forces in the theatre , carrying with him orders from King Louis XIV to push the Imperialists out of Italy . 

Foreseeing Villeroi 's intention of attacking at any price , Eugene entrenched himself in front of the small fortress of Chiari , and waited for the attack . 

In a battle that lasted several hours the Austrians inflicted heavy casualties on Villeroi 's forces , gaining an overwhelming victory . 

The campaign established Eugene in Lombardy , and helped to persuade the Maritime Powers to come to the aid of the Emperor . 

Within a week of the battle England , the Dutch Republic , and Leopold I , had signed the second treaty of the Grand Alliance .
