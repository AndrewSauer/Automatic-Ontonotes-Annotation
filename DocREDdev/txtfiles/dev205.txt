" Direction of Endeavor for Chinese Christianity in the Construction of New China " , commonly known as " The Christian Manifesto " or " The Three - Self Manifesto " , was a political manifesto of Protestants in China whereby they backed the newly - founded People 's Republic of China ( PRC ) and the leadership of the Communist Party of China ( CPC ) . 

Published in 1950 , the manifesto paved the way for the government - controlled Three - Self Patriotic Movement ( TSPM ) of Protestants . 

This movement proclaimed the three principles of self - government , self - support , and self - propagation . 

The drafting and content of the manifesto was , and remains , controversial to this day . 

The manifesto was devised after Protestant leaders presented their concerns with religious freedom to Zhou Enlai , the Premier of China . 

Instead of receiving their report , Zhou demanded them to come up with a statement in support of the new communist leadership . 

Y. T. Wu and other leftist clergymen espoused the task and presented a draft manifesto that , after some opposition and changes , became a foundational text of Christianity in the new People 's Republic . 

It condemns missionary activities in China as a form of imperialism , pledges loyalty to the communist leadership , and encourages the Church to take up an indigenous Chinese stance toward Christianity . 

Published on the front page of the People 's Daily , the manifesto was accompanied by a campaign to gather signatures . 

Many Christian leaders and laymen signed , while others refused to do so . 

After the Korean War broke out , the campaign became an increasingly politicized test of loyalty that became merged with the Campaign to Suppress Counterrevolutionaries . 

Some view the manifesto as a betrayal of the Church , while others find sympathy for the position of Chinese Christians struggling to reconcile their faith with the changed political realities . 

The manifesto ended missionary activities in China and the separation of church and state . 

It led to the founding the TSPM and brought persecution to dissidents .
