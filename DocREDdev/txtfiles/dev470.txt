Titanfall : Assault is a real - time strategy video game in the Titanfall series for mobile platforms in the style of Clash Royale . 

It was developed by Particle City and Respawn , published by Nexon , and released for iOS and Android in August 2017 . 

More titles are expected from Nexon and Respawn 's 2015 mobile game partnership . 

The Android version is also the first game in the Titanfall franchise not to be given the ESRB 's Mature rating . 

All servers for Titanfall : Assault were shut down on July 30th , 2018 and ability to download the game from Google Play on July 31 , 2018 . 

The game shutting down disappointed many titanfall fans as they had a game that was accessible on the android , google , and IOS devices which was a great way to play on the go .
