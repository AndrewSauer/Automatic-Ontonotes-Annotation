Cambodia was a farming area in the first and second millennia BC . 

States in the area engaged in trade in the Indian Ocean and exported rice surpluses . 

Complex irrigation systems were built in the 9th century . 

The French colonial period left the large feudal landholdings intact . 

Roads and a railway were built , and rubber , rice and corn grown . 

After independence Sihanouk pursued a policy of economic independence , securing aid and investment from a number of countries . 

Bombing and other effects of the war during the Vietnam War damaged rice production . 

Lon Nol had a policy of liberalising the economy . 

This was followed by the victory of the Khmer Rouge and the emptying of the cities . 

After the defeat of the Khmer Rouge , a Five Year Plan was adopted , aiming to improve agriculture , industry and distribution , with a slogan of " export and thrift " . 

Today , Cambodia remains a largely agricultural economy and industrial development is slow .
