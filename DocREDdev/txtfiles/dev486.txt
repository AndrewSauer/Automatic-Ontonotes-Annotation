Odessa is the sixth studio album by the Bee Gees , originally released on 30 March 1969 . 

Regarded as the most significant of the group 's Sixties albums , it was released as a double vinyl record initially in an opulent red flocked cover with gold lettering . 

An ambitious project , originally intended as a concept album on the loss of a fictional ship in 1899 , it created tension and disagreements in the band regarding the album 's direction ; finally , a dispute over which song to release as a single led to Robin Gibb temporarily leaving the group . 

The album was not well received by the public or the music press on release , and led to a decline in the group 's fortunes until their disco period in the mid 1970s . 

Released in March 1969 by Polydor Records in the UK and Atco Records in the US , it was the group 's fourth album released internationally , their sixth overall , and their only double album of original music . 

Odessa would be the final album for the band 's original incarnation , and this was the last album to include guitarist Vince Melouney . 

The album contains " First of May " , " Lamplight " , " Marley Purt Drive " and " Melody Fair " . 

The album was reissued as a single - disc in 1976 when interest was revived in the Bee Gees career , since then the album has gained increasing critical acclaim ; it was reissued again in 2009 as a deluxe 3 disc set , and is included in 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die .
