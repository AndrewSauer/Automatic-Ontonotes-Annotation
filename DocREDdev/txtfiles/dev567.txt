The scimitar oryx or scimitar - horned oryx ( Oryx dammah ) , also known as the Sahara oryx , is a species of Oryx once widespread across North Africa which went extinct in the wild in 2000 . 

It has a long taxonomic history since its scientific description in 1816 by Lorenz Oken , who named it Oryx algazel . 

This antelope stands a little more than at the shoulder . 

The males weigh and the females weigh . 

The coat is white with a red - brown chest and black markings on the forehead and down the length of the nose . 

The calves are born with a yellow coat without distinguishing marks ; their coats change to adult coloration at 3â€“12 months old . 

The scimitar oryx formed herds of mixed sexes of up to 70 members , usually guided by the bulls . 

They inhabited semideserts and deserts and were adapted to live in the extreme heat , with their efficient cooling mechanism and very low requirement of water . 

Scimitar oryx feed on foliage , grasses , succulent plants and plant parts during the night or early morning . 

Births peak between March and October . 

After a gestation of eight to nine months , one calf is born . 

Soon after , the female has a postpartum estrus . 

The scimitar oryx was once widespread across northern Africa . 

Its decline began as a result of climate change during the neolithic period , and later it was hunted extensively for its horns . 

Today , it is bred in captivity in special reserves in Tunisia , Morocco and Senegal and on private exotic animal ranches in the Texas Hill Country . 

In 2016 a reintroduction program was launched and currently a small herd has been successfully reintroduced in Chad . 

The scimitar oryx was domesticated in Ancient Egypt and is believed to have been used as food and sacrificed as offerings to gods . 

Wealthy people in Ancient Rome also bred them . 

The use of their valuable hides began in the Middle Ages . 

The unicorn myth may have originated from sightings of a scimitar oryx with a broken horn . 

The scimitar oryx was the emblem of the ancient Egyptian Oryx nome and today is the animal symbol of the Sahara Conservation Fund .
