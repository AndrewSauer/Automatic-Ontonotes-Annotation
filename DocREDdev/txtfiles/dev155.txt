The Link River is a short river connecting Upper Klamath Lake to Lake Ewauna in the city of Klamath Falls in the U.S. state of Oregon . 

Draining a basin of , the river begins at the southern end of Klamath Lake and flows a short distance to the Link River Dam and continues to the head of Lake Ewauna . 

The " falls " from which Klamath Falls derives its name , and which in reality are best described as rapids rather than falls , are visible a short distance below the dam , though the water flow is generally insufficient to provide water flow over the rocks . 

The Klamath River begins at the narrow southern end of Lake Ewauna and flows from there to the Pacific Ocean . 

Before settlers came to the Klamath Basin , the Link River was known to the local Klamaths as Yulalona , meaning " back and forth . " 

At times , strong winds blew the water upstream into Klamath Lake and partly drained the riverbed . 

After its founding in 1867 , Klamath Falls was originally named Linkville . 

The name was changed to Klamath Falls in 1892 â€“ 93 .
