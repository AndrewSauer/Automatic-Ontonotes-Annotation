Mola di Bari , commonly referred to simply as Mola ( Barese : ) , is a town and comune of the Metropolitan City of Bari , in the region of Apulia , in Southern Italy , on the Adriatic Sea . 

In recent times , the town was best known for having primarily whitewashed buildings , however , growth , modern construction , and building design have changed the image significantly , particularly in the northern ( and more modern ) part of the town . 

Mola 's city center is its main piazza , Piazza XX Settembre near the port and it also boasts a church ( Chiesa Matrice , i.e. 

Mother Church ) dating back to the 13thcentury . 

Bakeries in Mola are known for their focaccia food . 

Until the early 1990s , there were two privately owned public firewood ovens available to the inhabitants of Mola , one located on Via Nino Bixio , on the southern part of the town , and the other located on Via Pesce , on the opposite side of the main Piazza . 

These businesses served the local residents by providing a place to cook baked goods , primarily focaccia and breads . 

Typically , focaccia pans were quite large ( some approaching half a meter in diameter ) and were difficult to cook in one â€™s home . 

The tradition of sending items to be baked by the local oven has passed . 

Mola is also home to a large fishing industry that supplies fresh fish throughout the southern Italian region .
