Cornelius Ryan 's A Bridge Too Far gives an account of Operation Market Garden , a failed Allied attempt to break through German lines at Arnhem in the occupied Netherlands during World War II . 

The title of the book comes from a comment made by British Lieutenant General Frederick Browning , deputy commander of the First Allied Airborne Army , who told Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery before the operation , " I think we may be going a bridge too far . " 

Drawing on a wide variety of sources , Ryan also documented his account of the 1944 battle with pictures and maps and included a section on the survivors , “ Soldiers and Civilians – What They Do Today ” . 

One particular focus was on the tactical mistakes made in planning the operation . 

Until Ryan 's book , Market Garden had been a classic example of victors writing the history . 

Popular accounts of World War II usually tended not to mention the battle at all or put Montgomery 's spin on it as being a " partial success " . 

The 1974 book was published by Simon & Schuster in New York and by Hamish Hamilton in London . 

There were frequent later editions , and a film based on it was released in 1977 .
