Among the longest rivers of Canada are 47 streams of at least . 

In the case of some rivers such as the Columbia , the length listed in the table below is solely that of the main stem . 

In the case of others such as the Mackenzie , it is the combined lengths of the main stem and one or more upstream tributaries , as noted . 

Excluded from the list are rivers such as the Dauphin , a short connecting link between lakes Manitoba and Winnipeg , with main stems of or less . 

Also excluded are rivers such as the Mississippi , the main stems of which do not enter Canada even though some of their tributaries do . 

Nine rivers in this list cross international boundaries or form them . 

Four — the Yukon , Columbia , Porcupine , and Kootenay — begin in Canada and flow into the United States . 

Five — the Milk , Pend d'Oreille , Saint Lawrence , Red , and Saint John — begin in the United States and flow into Canada . 

Of these , the Milk and the Kootenay cross the international border twice , the Milk leaving and then re - entering the United States , the Kootenay leaving and then re - entering Canada . 

The drainage basins of these nine rivers extend into both countries ; in addition , the drainage basins of six others — the Fraser , Assiniboine , South Saskatchewan , Saskatchewan , Nelson , and Winnipeg — extend into the United States even though their main stems flow entirely within Canada . 

Sources report hydrological quantities with varied precision . 

Biologist and author Ruth Patrick , describing a table of high - discharge rivers , wrote that data on discharge , drainage area , and length varied widely among authors whose works she consulted . 

" It seems , " she said , " that the wisest course is to regard data tables such as the present one as showing the general ranks of rivers , and not to place too much importance on minor ( 10–20 % ) differences in figures . "
