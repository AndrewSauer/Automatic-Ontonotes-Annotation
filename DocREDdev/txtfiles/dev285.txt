The Railroad Revival Tour was an annual music tour that featured popular roots , folk , country , rock , bluegrass and Americana acts that began in 2011 . 

The musicians travel between shows across the American Southwest in a dozen or so vintage train cars from the 1950s and 1960s . 

The outdoor concert locations , sometimes attracting over 10,000 fans , are often a stone 's throw from the train . 

The bands eat , sleep and engage in impromptu jam sessions on the train between stops , giving them a chance to collaborate . 

On stage at night , they often join in on each other 's sets , sometimes bringing around 30 musicians up to create a rare and rowdy performance . 

The organic American roots feeling of the tour also prompts participating musicians to honor U.S. railway history , like Mumford & Sons ' tribute to Woody Guthrie in 2011 . 

The inaugural tour in 2011 included performances by Mumford & Sons , Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros , and Old Crow Medicine Show . 

A documentary of this first year , called Big Easy Express , directed by Emmett Malloy premiered at SXSW 2012 and won a Grammy Award in 2013 . 

The film is currently available on iTunes and DVD / Blu - ray Disc . 

In 2011 , Railroad Revival Tour bands Mumford & Sons , Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros , and Old Crow Medicine Show together closed their shows at every stop with " This Train . " 

The 2012 tour was slated to include performances by Willie Nelson , Band of Horses , Jamey Johnson , and John Reilly and Friends . 

However , the tour was cancelled for 2012 .
