Francesco De Masi ( 11 January 1930 â€“ 6 November 2005 ) was an Italian conductor and film score composer . 

He studied composition at the San Pietro a Maiella Conservatory in Naples , under the guidance of Achille Longo , his uncle . 

De Masi became interested in film music when Longo was asked to compose a soundtrack for a film , and he asked De Masi to be his assistant . 

De Masi 's filmography includes scores for over 200 films and TV series , ranging from spaghetti westerns and sword and sandal epics to gialli and horror films , such as Lucio Fulci 's Lo squartatore di New York ( The New York Ripper ) . 

De Masi also scored several action films , such as Enzo G. Castellari 's Quel maledetto treno blindato ( The Inglorious Bastards ) , but he is best remembered for his work on spaghetti westerns . 

Unlike most other composers , De Masi started writing western scores slightly earlier than the genre 's most influential musician , Ennio Morricone . 

As De Masi 's music was less influenced by Morricone , his style had a distinctive sound . 

Many of his songs were performed by the low - voiced member of the I Cantori Moderni choir , Ettore " Raoul " Lovecchio . 

De Masi was also very interested in classical music . 

He taught at the Santa Cecilia Conservatory , also conducting the conservatory 's orchestra . 

In an interview , De Masi listed Palestrina , Karlheinz Stockhausen , Ravel and Shostakovich as his main classical influences . 

De Masi died of cancer at the age of 75 .
