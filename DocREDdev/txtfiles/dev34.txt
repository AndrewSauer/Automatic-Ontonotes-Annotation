The Old Loggers Path ( OLP ) is a loop hiking trail in Lycoming County in north - central Pennsylvania in the United States . 

Marked with international orange blazes , the Old Loggers Path is located entirely within the Loyalsock State Forest . 

Most hikers take two and a half to three days and two nights to complete the Old Loggers Path , making it popular for weekend hikes . 

Highlights of the trail include waterfalls , several scenic streams and creeks ( most of which do not have bridges ) , and panoramic vistas . 

The land the Old Loggers Path is on was initially owned and clear - cut by the Union Tanning Company , followed by the Central Pennsylvania Lumber Company . 

The trail chiefly follows the grades of abandoned logging roads and railroads , and its trailhead is the lumber ghost town of Masten . 

Parts of the trail were made by the Civilian Conservation Corps , which operated a camp in the area from 1933 to 1941 .
