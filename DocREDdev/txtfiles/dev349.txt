Song of Freedom is a 1936 British film directed by J. 

Elder Wills and starring Paul Robeson . 

One of two elements pivotal to the plot is an opera composer named Gabriel Donizetti , presumably suggested by the historical opera composer Gaetano Donizetti . 

The other is a medallion that serves to identify Robeson 's character as a descendant of an African monarch . 

Song of Freedom may best represent the opportunity Robeson was looking for to " give a true picture of many aspects of the life of the coloured man in the West . 

Hitherto on the screen , he has been characterized or presented only as a comedy character . 

This film shows him as a real man . " 

Robeson was also given final cut approval on the film , an unprecedented option at the time for an actor of any race . 

As in Sanders of the River , the film called for documentary scenes of West African traditional dances and ceremonies , but this time Robeson obtained a contract giving him final cut , so that the film â€™s message would not be changed behind the doors of the editing room . 

Robeson plays Zinga , a black dockworker in England with a great baritone singing voice . 

He is discovered by an opera impresario , and is catapulted into great fame as an international opera star . 

Yet he feels alienated from his African past , and out of place in England . 

By chance , he is informed that an ancestral medallion that he wears is proof of his lineage to African kings , and he leaves fame and fortune to take his rightful place of royalty . 

Reunited with his people , he plans to improve their lives by combining the best of western technology with the best of traditional African ways . 

Although the film was not a box office success in the US , it was notably chosen in 1950 to open the convention of Ghana 's Convention People 's Party . 

The ceremonies were presided over by the future first prime minister of independent Ghana , Kwame Nkrumah , Robeson 's friend from his London years .
