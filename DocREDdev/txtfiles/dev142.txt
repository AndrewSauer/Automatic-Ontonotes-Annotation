" Burns Verkaufen der Kraftwerk " ( ) is the eleventh episode of The Simpsons ' third season . 

It first aired on the Fox network in the United States on December 5 , 1991 . 

In the episode , Mr. Burns wishes to pursue other interests and therefore decides to sell his power plant to two German investors for $ 100 million . 

Safety inspector Homer is immediately fired by the Germans because of his incompetence . 

Later , Burns realizes that he has lost all his respectability because he can no longer control anyone .

Originally , the writers wanted to have Burns sell the plant to the Japanese , but they decided that it would have been too clich√©d ; the plot , however , remained the same with the Germans . 

The title is an inaccurate German translation of " Burns sells the power plant " , the correct version being Burns verkauft das Kraftwerk . 

In its original airing on the Fox network , the episode had a 12.6 Nielsen rating , finishing the week ranked 38th . 

" Burns Verkaufen der Kraftwerk " received generally positive reviews from critics and was praised for several scenes , particularly the " Land of Chocolate " sequence in which Homer dances around in an imaginary land made entirely out of chocolate .
