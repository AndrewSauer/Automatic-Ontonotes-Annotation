The Romanian Revolution of 1989 , which ended the Communist regime of Nicolae Ceauşescu in December 1989 , offered the 15 religious denominations then recognized in Romania the chance to regain the terrain lost after 1945 , the year when Dr. Petru Groza of the Ploughmen 's Front , a party closely associated with the Communists , became prime minister . 

From that time , the Communist Party started a campaign of secularisation , seeking to transform the country into an atheistic state along Marxist - Leninist lines . 

Beginning with the 1989 revolution , the legally recognized churches , especially the Romanian Orthodox Church , the country ’s largest religious group , pressured the post - communist authorities to introduce religious education in public schools , offer substantial financial support for theological institutions and allow denominations to resume their social role by posting clergy in hospitals , elderly care homes and prisons . 

Although education was an area where churches registered success in the early stages of post - communist transition , religious education remains a low priority in Romania .
