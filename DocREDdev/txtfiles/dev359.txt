" Charles Guiteau " ( LAWS E11 ) Roud 444 is a traditional song about the assassination of US President James A. Garfield by Charles J. Guiteau . 

It is based on another old ballad , " James A. Rogers " . 

The song is told from the point of view of the assassin himself . 

For a while , it was believed that Guiteau wrote the song himself , possibly because of the poem " I am Going to the Lordy " , which Guiteau actually did write on the day of his execution . 

It is not to be confused with another ballad about the assassination , " Mr. Garfield , " which was popularized by Johnny Cash . 

Bascom Lamar Lunsford recorded both songs in 1949 for the Library of Congress .
