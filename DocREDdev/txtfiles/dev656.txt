The International Music Festival ‘ Chopin and his Europe’ – an international music festival organised in Warsaw since 2005 by the Fryderyk Chopin Institute , presenting European music within the context of its links with the life and work of the Polish pianist , composer and teacher Fryderyk Chopin ( 1810 – 1849 ) . 

The project is realised as part of the government programme ‘ Fryderyk Chopin Heritage 2010’ . 

It is one of the annual cultural events of the summer in Poland , devised by artistic director Stanisław Leszczyński . 

One important strand to the festival programme is historical performance – presenting works as they were originally heard , on period pianos in the possession of the Fryderyk Chopin Institute : an Erard from 1849 , a Pleyel from 1846 and a Graf ( a copy of an instrument from c. 1819 ) . 

The festival is organised in collaboration with the Warsaw Philharmonic , Teatr Wielki – Polish National Opera and Polish Radio II . 

Each year , the invited guests include performers from around the world , many of whom have a special connection with the festival , including Marta Argerich , Nelson Goerner , Dina Yoffe , Tobias Koch , Ivo Pogorelich , Garrick Ohlsson and Jan Lisiecki . 

The festival also features performances by finalists and other participants in the Chopin Competition .
