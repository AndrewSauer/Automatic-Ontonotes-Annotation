The Canadian cartoonist James Llewellyn " Jimmy " Frise ( , 16 October 1891   – 13 June 1948 ) is best known for his work on the comic strip Birdseye and his illustrations of humorous prose pieces by Greg Clark . 

Born in Scugog Island , Ontario , Frise moved to Toronto at 19 and found illustration work on the Toronto Stars Star Weekly supplement . 

His left hand was severely injured at the Battle of Vimy Ridge in 1917 during World War   I , but his drawing hand was unhurt , and he continued cartooning at the Star upon his return . 

In 1919 he began his first weekly comic strip , Life 's Little Comedies , which evolved into the rural - centred humorous Birdseye in 1923 . 

He moved to the Montreal Standard in 1947 , but as the Star kept publication rights to Birdseye Center , Frise continued it as Juniper Junction with strongly similar characters and situations . 

Doug Wright took over the strip after Frise 's sudden death from a heart attack in 1948 , and it went on to become the longest - running strip in English - Canadian comics history .
