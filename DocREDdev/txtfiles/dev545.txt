" Two Doors Down " was a song written and performed by Dolly Parton , which provided a 1978 U.S. country and pop hit for her . 

The song was sung from the perspective of a woman who has just broken up with her boyfriend and is debating attending a party two doors down the hall from her apartment . 

She decides to go , meets a new man and returns with him to her own apartment " two doors down " . 

It was included on Parton 's 1977 Here You Come Again album , but before Parton could release it as the album 's second single in March 1978 , singer Zella Lehr released a cover version that became a top ten U.S. country hit . 

While Lehr 's version was on the country charts , the title cut of Here You Come Again was becoming a much bigger pop hit than Parton had anticipated . 

Wanting to capitalize on her newfound pop success ( and also not wanting to compete with Lehr 's country version of the song ) Parton rerecorded a more loose , pop - oriented version of " Two Doors Down " with a slight disco flavoring . 

She released the new version on a double - A - sided single , with the other side , " It 's All Wrong , but It 's All Right " intended for country airplay , and " Two Doors Down " intended for the pop airplay . 

The single topped the U.S. country charts , and was a top-20 pop hit for Parton , and went on to be one of her most popular hits . 

Also in 1978 Joe Thomas did his own disco cover of this song . 

Parton also had the new version of " Two Doors Down " ( which omitted the first verse , and included an upbeat " sing - along " bridge ) replace the previous version on all subsequent pressings of Here You Come Again , making the earlier version something of a collectors ' item among Parton 's fans . 

The original version of " Two Doors Down " was subsequently issued on CD in 2000 on the 3-CD Australian compilation Legendary Dolly Parton , which is now out of print . 

In 2009 , Jill Johnson recorded the song on the cover album Music Row II .
