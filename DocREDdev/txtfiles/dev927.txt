The Battle of Kashii ( 樫井の戦い ) was the very first battle of the Summer Campaign of the 1615 Siege of Osaka , near the beginning of the Edo period in Japan . 

It took place on the 26th day of the 4th month of the Keichō era . 

As the Shōgun 's Eastern Army prepared to renew , the siege begun the previous winter , the Ōsaka garrison sallied forth , ambushing Tokugawa forces in a number of skirmishes and sieges . 

In the battle of Kashii , a contingent of forces loyal to Toyotomi Hideyori , lord of Ōsaka , attempted to besiege Wakayama Castle , which was controlled by Asano Nagaakira , an ally of the shōgun . 

The attackers were led by Ōno Harunaga , Hanawa Naoyuki , and Okabe Noritsuna . 

Asano 's garrison realized that their attackers were far from support or reinforcements , and met them in battle at Kashii , a short distance from Wakayama . 

Okabe and Hanawa were killed in the battle , and Ōno was therefore forced to retreat back to Ōsaka .
