This is a list of the operating Victorian regional railway stations serviced by V / Line operated trains . 

The stations make up seven radial passenger train lines , which all operate from Southern Cross station in Melbourne , Australia , with two further lines proposed to be reopened to V / Line passenger rail services . 

Stations listed in bold are terminus stations . 

Frequent services operate to the major regional cities of Ballarat , Bendigo , Geelong , Seymour , and the Latrobe Valley ; with a smaller number of services continuing to the end of their respective lines . 

Services to Ballarat , Bendigo , Geelong , and the Latrobe Valley were upgraded as part of the Regional Fast Rail project completed in 2006 . 

Four lines previously closed to passenger services - those to Ararat , Bairnsdale , Leongatha and Mildura were proposed to be refurbished as part of the Linking Victoria project . 

While all were expected to reopen during 2004 , only the Ararat and Bairnsdale lines have been reopened , with the Leongatha and Mildura projects delayed .
