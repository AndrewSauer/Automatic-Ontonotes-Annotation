Holden New Zealand Limited , named until 1994 as General Motors New Zealand Limited , is a subsidiary of General Motors of Detroit and distributes General Motors ' motor vehicles , engines , components and parts in New Zealand . 

Its Buick , Chevrolet , Oakland , Oldsmobile and Cadillac brands were all well - established before the first World War . 

This company was incorporated on 4 January 1926 to build and operate a local assembly plant , General Motors ' first owned not leased overseas plant . 

Its popular cars , including British Vauxhalls , remained common household brands until well after the second World War . 

Postwar British sourced Vauxhalls continued to keep the plant running together with limited numbers ( restricted by currency shortages ) of Chevrolets . 

In the late 1950s the Vauxhall and the now expansive Chevrolet and Pontiac cars began to be replaced with Australian sourced Holden vehicles supplemented by the smallest Vauxhalls and Holdens and the move to the Holden brand was completed in the 1970s . 

The assembly of vehicles ended in 1990 and since then the business has been distribution of complete imported vehicles and spare parts .
