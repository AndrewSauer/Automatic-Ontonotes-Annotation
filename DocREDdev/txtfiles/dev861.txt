Ferrous metallurgy is the metallurgy of iron and its alloys . 

It began far back in prehistory . 

The earliest surviving iron artifacts , from the 4th millennium BC in Egypt , were made from meteoritic iron - nickel . 

It is not known when or where the smelting of iron from ores began , but by the end of the 2nd millennium BC iron was being produced from iron ores from Sub - Saharan Africa to China . 

The use of wrought iron ( worked iron ) was known by the 1st millennium BC , and its spread marked the Iron Age . 

During the medieval period , means were found in Europe of producing wrought iron from cast iron ( in this context known as pig iron ) using finery forges . 

For all these processes , charcoal was required as fuel . 

Steel ( with a carbon content between pig iron and wrought iron ) was first produced in antiquity as an alloy . 

Its process of production , Wootz steel , was exported before the 4th century BC from India to ancient China , Africa , the Middle East and Europe . 

Archaeological evidence of cast iron appears in 5th - century BC China . 

New methods of producing it by carburizing bars of iron in the cementation process were devised in the 17th century . 

During the Industrial Revolution , new methods of producing bar iron by substituting coke for charcoal were devised and these were later applied to produce steel , creating a new era of greatly increased use of iron and steel that some contemporaries described as a new Iron Age . 

In the late 1850s , Henry Bessemer invented a new steelmaking process , that involved blowing air through molten pig iron to burn off carbon , and so to produce mild steel . 

This and other 19th - century and later steel making processes have displaced wrought iron . 

Today , wrought iron is no longer produced on a commercial scale , having been displaced by the functionally equivalent mild or low carbon steel . 

The largest and most modern underground iron ore mine in the world is located in Kiruna , Norrbotten County , Lapland . 

The mine which is owned by Luossavaara - Kiirunavaara AB , a large Swedish mining company , has an annual production capacity of over 26 million tonnes of iron ore .
