Janaka was a king of Videha , approximately in the 8th or 7th century BCE , who later appears as a character in the Ramayana . 

He is revered as being an ideal example of non - attachment to material possessions . 

As a king , he had access to luxuries and pleasures far beyond the ordinary , but his internal state was closer to that of a sadhu . 

He was intensely interested in spiritual discourse and considered himself free from worldly illusions . 

His interactions with sages and seekers such as Ashtavakra and Sulabha are recorded in ancient texts . 

His relationship with adopted daughter Sita led her to be called Janaki Mata . 

The Nepalese city of Janakpur is named for him and daughter Sita . 

The Videha ( or Mithila ) kingdom was located between east of Gandaki River , west of Mahananda River , north of Ganga river and south of Himalayas . 

The region is now divided between the present day Indian state of Bihar and a small part of Terai Region in Nepal .
