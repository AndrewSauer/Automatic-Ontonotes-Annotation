Laurence Massillon Keitt ( October 4 , 1824 – June 2 , 1864 ) was an American planter , lawyer , politician , and soldier from South Carolina . 

During his tenure in the United States House of Representatives , he was included in several lists of Fire - Eaters — men who adamantly urged the secession of southern states from the United States , and who resisted measures of compromise and reconciliation , leading to the American Civil War . 

Keitt is notable for being involved in two separate acts of legislative violence in the Congressional chambers . 

In the first , Keitt assisted Representative Preston Brooks ( D - SC ) in his 1856 attack on Senator Charles Sumner ( R - MA ) in the Senate chamber by brandishing a pistol and cane to prevent other Senators from coming to Sumner 's aid . 

The second was in 1858 , when he attacked and attempted to choke Representative Galusha Grow ( R - PA ) during an argument on the floor of the U.S. House . 

When the Civil War began , he served as a deputy of the Provisional Confederate States Congress and later as a colonel in the Confederate States Army , until he was mortally wounded at the Battle of Cold Harbor in June 1864 .
