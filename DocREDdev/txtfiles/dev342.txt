Stars and Stripes Forever is a 1952 American Technicolor film biography of the late-19th-/early-20th - century composer and band leader John Philip Sousa . 

This 20th Century Fox feature was produced by Lamar Trotti , directed by Henry Koster , and stars Clifton Webb , Debra Paget , Robert Wagner , and Ruth Hussey . 

The film 's title is taken from Sousa 's " The Stars and Stripes Forever " , which has become the best known of his military marches . 

While the film 's storyline is loosely based on Sousa 's autobiography Marching Along , the film takes considerable liberties and dramatic license , often expanding and examining themes and passages from Sousa 's book . 

Two examples : In the film , Private Willie Little ( Robert Wagner ) , is credited with inventing the Sousaphone and naming it after his mentor , but in reality Sousa himself designed the instrument . 

The inspiration for the film 's title march is depicted in a scene with a voice over by Webb quoting Sousa 's actual description of its creation while he was aboard ship recovering from typhoid fever . 

In reality , having learned of the sudden death of his band 's manager , Sousa and his wife canceled their European vacation and were returning to the U.S. by steamship when the march came to him .
