The Catholic Church in the Maldives is part of the worldwide Catholic Church , under the spiritual leadership of the Pope in Rome . 

The Annals of the Propagation of the Faith mentions that in 1833 after the consecration of Cl√©ment Bonnand as the Vicar Apostolic of Pondicherry , he was authorized by the Holy See to send missionaries to the Maldive Islands where the Christian faith has not reached . 

But there is not and has never been any Catholic territorial jurisdiction in the Maldives , but has been covered by the Archdiocese of Colombo in Sri Lanka since 1886 . 

The constitution of the island does not allow citizenship of those who are not Muslims , and those found with non - Islamic religious materials can be subject to arrest . 

It currently has the smallest amount of Catholics attending mass .
