Independence Pass , originally known as Hunter Pass , is a high mountain pass in the Rocky Mountains of central Colorado in the United States . 

It is at elevation on the Continental Divide in the Sawatch Range . 

The pass is midway between Aspen and Twin Lakes , on the border between Pitkin and Lake counties . 

State Highway 82 traverses it , in the process reaching the highest elevation of a paved Colorado state highway on a through road . 

After Cottonwood Pass to the south , it is the second - highest pass with an improved road in the state , the fourth - highest paved road in the state and the highest paved crossing of the Continental Divide in the U.S. Because of the heavy snowfall at its elevation , it is closed in wintertime , isolating Aspen from direct access from the east during the ski season . 

When the pass is open in warmer weather , it is a popular destination . 

A scenic overlook near the pass allows visitors to take in the alpine tundra environment above treeline , and offers excellent views to the east of Mount Elbert , Colorado 's highest peak and the second - highest mountain in the contiguous United States . 

Rock climbers are drawn to nearby bouldering opportunities , and informal paths lead to nearby mountain summits of even higher elevation . 

Backcountry skiers make use of the slopes during the late spring and early summer . 

Since 2011 the pass has been on the route of the USA Pro Cycling Challenge . 

The pass was formed by glacial action and erosion in the region , and its first recorded sighting was by Zebulon Pike in 1806 . 

Ferdinand Hayden surveyed it in 1873 . 

As part of the Continental Divide , it was the limit of European settlement in the region at the time , with the land to the west reserved for the Ute people . 

Prospectors who defied governor Frederick Walker Pitkin 's order crossed the pass on July 4 , 1879 , giving it its current name and setting up a similarly named village ( now a ghost town ) to its west . 

A toll road built across the pass was abandoned and neglected after a railroad connection was made to Aspen . 

A new road replaced it in the 1920s ; portions of the old route can still be seen along the western approach . 

The Independence Pass Foundation , based in Aspen , works to repair damage to the pass 's environment caused by both roads since 1984 .
