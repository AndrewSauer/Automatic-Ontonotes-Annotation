Henry Wager Halleck ( January 16 , 1815 â€“ January 9 , 1872 ) was a United States Army officer , scholar , and lawyer . 

A noted expert in military studies , he was known by a nickname that became derogatory : " Old Brains . " 

He was an important participant in the admission of California as a state and became a successful lawyer and land developer . 

Halleck served as General - in - Chief of all Union armies during the American Civil War . 

Early in the Civil War , Halleck was a senior Union Army commander in the Western Theater . 

He commanded operations in the Western Theater from 1861 until 1862 , during which time , while the Union armies in the east were defeated and held back , the troops under Halleck 's command won many important victories . 

However , Halleck was not present at the battles , and his subordinates earned most of the recognition . 

The only operation in which Halleck exercised field command was the Siege of Corinth in the spring of 1862 , a Union victory which he conducted with extreme caution . 

Halleck also developed rivalries with many of his subordinate generals , such as Ulysses S. Grant and Don Carlos Buell . 

In July 1862 , following Major General George B. McClellan 's failed Peninsula Campaign in the Eastern Theater , Halleck was promoted to general - in - chief of all U.S. armies . 

Halleck served in this capacity for about a year and a half . 

Halleck was a cautious general who believed strongly in thorough preparations for battle and in the value of defensive fortifications over quick , aggressive action . 

He was a master of administration , logistics , and the politics necessary at the top of the military hierarchy , but exerted little effective control over field operations from his post in Washington , D.C. His subordinates frequently criticized him and at times ignored his instructions . 

President Abraham Lincoln once described him as " little more than a first rate clerk . " 

In March 1864 , Grant was promoted to general - in - chief , and Halleck was relegated to chief - of - staff . 

Without the pressure of having to control the movements of the armies , Halleck performed capably in this task , ensuring that the Union armies were well - equipped .
