George Washington 's resignation as commander - in - chief marked the end of Washington 's military service in the American Revolutionary War and his return to civilian life at Mount Vernon . 

His voluntary action has been described as " one of the nation 's great acts of statesmanship " and helped establish the precedent of civilian control of the military . 

After the Treaty of Paris ending the war had been signed on September 3 , 1783 , and after the last British troops left New York City on November 25 , Washington resigned his commission as commander - in - chief of the Continental Army to the Congress of the Confederation , then meeting in the Maryland State House at Annapolis , Maryland , on December 23 of the same year . 

This followed his farewell to the Continental Army , November 2 at Rockingham near Princeton , New Jersey , and his farewell to his officers , December 4 at Fraunces Tavern in New York City .
