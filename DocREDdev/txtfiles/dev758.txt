The genocide of indigenous peoples is the mass destruction of entire communities of indigenous peoples . 

Indigenous peoples are understood to be people whose historical and current territory has become occupied by colonial expansion , or the formation of a state by a dominant group such as a colonial power . 

While the concept of genocide was formulated by Raphael Lemkin in the mid-20th century , the earlier expansion of various European colonial powers such as the Spanish and British empires , and the subsequent establishment of colonies on indigenous territory , frequently involved acts of genocidal violence against indigenous groups in the Americas , Australia , Africa and Asia . 

According to Lemkin , colonization was in itself " intrinsically genocidal " . 

He saw this genocide as a two - stage process , the first being the destruction of the indigenous population 's way of life . 

In the second stage , the newcomers impose their way of life on the indigenous group . 

According to David Maybury - Lewis , imperial and colonial forms of genocide are enacted in two main ways , either through the deliberate clearing of territories of their original inhabitants in order to make them exploitable for purposes of resource extraction or colonial settlements , or through enlisting indigenous peoples as forced laborers in colonial or imperialist projects of resource extraction . 

The designation of specific events as genocidal is often controversial . 

Some scholars , among them Lemkin , have argued that cultural genocide , sometimes called ethnocide , should also be recognized . 

A people may continue to exist , but if they are prevented from perpetuating their group identity by prohibitions against cultural and religious practices that are the basis of that identity , this may also be considered a form of genocide . 

Examples include the treatment of Tibetans by the Chinese government and Native Americans by the US government .
