Kusha or Kusa ( Sanskrit : कुश ) and his twin brother Lava were the children of Rama and Sita . 

Their story is recounted in the Hindu epic , the Ramayana . 

Hindu traditions claim he ruled the entire region of Kashmir , Indus River and Hindu Kush as frontier lands of India known as Hindu Kush Kshetra and founded the city of Kashmir in the valley and Kasur with Lavapuri of lava in base lands , though local lore contends Kasur was founded in 1525 by Pashtun migrants . 

His brother Lava is traditionally believed to have founded Lavapuri ( current day city of Lahore ) . 

The imperial line that ruled Kingdom of Benares - Kashi and the Maurya Empire , which ruled South Asia from 320 - 185 BCE , claimed descent from Kusha . 

Kusha is said to be an Raghuvanshi Ikshvaku Suryavanshi .
