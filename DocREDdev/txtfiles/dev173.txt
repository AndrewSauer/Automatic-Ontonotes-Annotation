Elizabeth II was Queen of Mauritius from 1968 to 1992 . 

Mauritius was a constitutional monarchy with Elizabeth as head of state . 

The Queen was also the monarch of the United Kingdom and the other Commonwealth realms . 

Her constitutional roles in Mauritius were delegated to a Governor - General . 

The Parliament of the United Kingdom 's Mauritius Independence Act 1968 transformed the British Crown Colony of Mauritius into an independent sovereign state . 

Unusually , no member of the British royal family attended the independence ceremony on the island because of security concerns . 

Princess Alexandra was due to attend but after communal violence the British Minister of State for the Commonwealth , Lord Shepherd , advised that her visit be cancelled . 

The Queen and her husband Prince Philip , Duke of Edinburgh , visited Mauritius for three days ( 24â€“26 March ) in 1972 , as part of a tour of Asia and Africa . 

They arrived in Port Louis on the royal yacht Britannia after visiting the Seychelles . 

They were met by a crowd of nearly a quarter of a million people , and rode through the city in an open - topped car . 

During the visit , the Queen opened the sixth session of the third Mauritius Parliament . 

The royal couple left Mauritius for Nairobi by air . 

It was the first ever visit to the island by a reigning monarch . 

Mauritius became a republic within the Commonwealth in 1992 with the President of Mauritius replacing the Queen as head of state . 

To date , Mauritius is the most recent of the Queen 's realms to become a republic .
