Kiirunavaara ( Northern Sami : Gironvárri , Meänkieli : Kierunavaara ) is a mountain in Kiruna , Sweden that contains one of the largest and richest bodies of iron ore in the world . 

The presence of iron in the area was known already in the mid-17th century , but at this early time communication lines to this northerly region were quite insufficient to permit any major exploitation . 

Only with the construction of a railway , the Iron Ore Line and the ports of Narvik and Luleå at the end of the 19th century did commercial mining become a realistic proposition . 

The Swedish mining company LKAB ( Luossavaara - Kiirunavaara Aktiebolag ) has been mining the mountain since the beginning of the 20th century . 

The mining area around Kiruna and Malmberget and the iron port and steelworks at Luleå made Norrbotten County one of the first , and most prominent , regions of heavy industry in Sweden , and the wider region has remained at the forefront of mining and steel smelting and alloying technology .
