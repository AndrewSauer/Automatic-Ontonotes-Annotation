Die Haut ( German for the skin ) were an experimental German post - punk and post - rock band , who enjoyed some local success in Berlin during the 1980s and 1990s , with such records as the Nick Cave collaboration Burnin ' the Ice . 

The only constant member was Christoph Dreher . 

Formed as an instrumental rock quartet , many of their recordings and live performances featured an array of international guest vocalists . 

Their last full - length album was " Spring " ( 1997 ) followed by a remix album called " Springer " ( 1998 ) . 

At the same time the band went on hiatus , Remo Park and Christoph Dreher have continued to work as separate acts , and Jochen Arbeit with Rudi Moser joined the Berlin - based underground legend Einst√ºrzende Neubauten .
