The Scotia Plate ( ) is a tectonic plate on the edge of the South Atlantic and Southern Ocean . 

Thought to have formed during the early Eocene with the opening of the Drake Passage that separates South America from Antarctica , it is a minor plate whose movement is largely controlled by the two major plates that surround it : the South American plate and Antarctic plate . 

Roughly rhomboid , extending between and , the plate is wide and long . 

It is moving WSW at /year and the South Sandwich Plate is moving east at /year in an absolute reference frame . 

It takes its name from the steam yacht Scotia of the Scottish National Antarctic Expedition ( 1902 â€“ 04 ) , the expedition that made the first bathymetric study of the region . 

The Scotia Plate is made of oceanic crust and continental fragments now distributed around the Scotia Sea . 

Before the formation of the plate began ( 40Ma ) , these fragments formed a continuous landmass from Patagonia to the Antarctic Peninsula along an active subduction margin . 

At present the plate is almost completely submerged , with only the small exceptions of the South Georgia Islands on its northeastern edge and the southern tip of South America .
