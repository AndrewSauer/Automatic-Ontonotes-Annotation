Like every other Tōshō - gū shrine , it is characterized by enshrining the first shōgun of the Tokugawa Shogunate , Tokugawa Ieyasu with the name Tōshō Daigongen ( 東照大権現 ) . 

The seated wooden statue of Tokugawa enshrined there has been designated an Important Cultural Property by the Tokyo Metropolitan Government . 

Located inside Shiba Park , just beside the Buddhist temple Zōjō - ji , an important Jōdo - shū temple and popular attraction , and close to Tokyo Tower , Shiba Tōshō - gū can be included in the same visiting course . 

Shiba Tōshō - gū is notable for its giant ginkgo tree , one of the biggest in Tokyo , with a height of 21.5 m and a trunk circumference of 6.5 m. It is believed that Tokugawa Iemitsu , the third Tokugawa shōgun , planted the tree himself , when the Tōshō - gū shrine was rebuilt in 1641 . 

Although slightly damaged on the branches and the tip of the trunk , it was designated Natural Monument in 1956 . 

Another giant ginkgo tree of similar characteristics in Tokyo is located in the grounds of Oji Shrine .
