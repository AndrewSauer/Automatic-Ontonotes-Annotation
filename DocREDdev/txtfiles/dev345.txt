Historiographic metafiction is a term coined by Canadian literary theorist Linda Hutcheon in the late 1980s . 

The term is used for works of fiction which combine the literary devices of metafiction with historical fiction . 

Works regarded as historiographic metafiction are also distinguished by frequent allusions to other artistic , historical and literary texts ( i.e. 

intertextuality ) in order to show the extent to which works of both literature and historiography are dependent on the history of discourse . 

The term is closely associated with works of postmodern literature , usually novels . 

According to Hutcheon , in " A Poetics of Postmodernism " , works of historiographic metafiction are " those well - known and popular novels which are both intensely self - reflexive and yet paradoxically also lay claim to historical events and personages " . 

Works often described as examples of historiographical metafiction include : William Shakespeare 's Pericles , Prince of Tyre ( c.1608 ) , John Fowles ' The French Lieutenant 's Woman ( 1969 ) , E. L. Doctorow 's Ragtime ( 1975 ) , William Kennedy 's Legs ( 1975 ) , Salman Rushdie 's Midnight 's Children ( 1981 ) , A. S. Byatt 's Possession ( 1990 ) , Michael Ondaatje 's The English Patient ( 1992 ) , Thomas Pynchon 's Mason & Dixon ( 1997 ) and many others . 

By seeking to represent both actual historical events from World War Two while , at the same time , problematizing the very notion of doing exactly that , Kurt Vonnegut 's Slaughterhouse - Five ( 1969 ) features a metafictional , " Janus - headed " perspective .
