Beyond Good & Evil is a 2003 action - adventure video game developed and published by Ubisoft for the PlayStation 2 , Microsoft Windows , Xbox and GameCube platforms . 

The story follows the adventures of Jade , an investigative reporter and martial artist , who works with a resistance movement to reveal a planet - wide alien conspiracy . 

The player controls Jade and allies , solving puzzles , fighting enemies , and obtaining photographic evidence . 

Michel Ancel , creator of the Rayman series , envisioned the game as the first part of a trilogy . 

The game was developed under the codename " Project BG&E ; " by 30 Ubisoft Pictures employees with production lasting more than three years . 

One of the main goals of the game is to create a meaningful story while giving players lots of freedom , though the game adopts a relatively linear structure . 

The game was received poorly when it was shown at E3 2002 , and it prompted the developers to change some of the game 's elements , including Jade 's design . 

Ancel also attempted to streamline the game in order to make the game more commercially appealing . 

Beyond Good & Evil was critically acclaimed . 

Critics praised the game 's animation , setting , story , and design , but criticized the game 's combat and technical issues . 

The game received a nomination for " Game of the Year " at the 2004 Game Developers Choice Awards . 

While the game had a cult following , it was considered a commercial failure at launch . 

A full HD re - mastered version of the game was released on Xbox Live Arcade in March 2011 and on PlayStation Network in June 2011 . 

A prequel , Beyond Good and Evil 2 , is in development and was announced at E3 2017 .
