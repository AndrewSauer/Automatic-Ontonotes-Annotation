Skylake is the codename used by Intel for a processor microarchitecture that was launched in August 2015 succeeding the Broadwell microarchitecture . 

Skylake is a microarchitecture redesign using the same 14 Â  nm manufacturing process technology as its predecessor , serving as a " tock " in Intel 's " tick - tock " manufacturing and design model . 

According to Intel , the redesign brings greater CPU and GPU performance and reduced power consumption . 

Skylake CPUs share its microarchitecture with Kaby Lake , Coffee Lake and Cannon Lake CPUs . 

Skylake is the last Intel platform on which Windows earlier than Windows 10 will be officially supported by Microsoft , although enthusiast - created modifications exist that allow Windows 8.1 and earlier to continue to receive updates on later platforms . 

Some of the processors based on the Skylake microarchitecture are marketed as " 6th - generation Core " . 

On October 8 , 2018 , Intel announced new 9th gen Core X 98xx/99xx series CPUs , with the Core i9 - 9980XE Extreme Edition leading the launch .
