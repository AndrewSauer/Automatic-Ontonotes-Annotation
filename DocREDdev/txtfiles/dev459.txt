The United States Marine Band is the premier band of the United States Marine Corps . 

Established by act of Congress on July 11 , 1798 , it is the oldest of the United States military bands and the oldest professional musical organization in the United States . 

Today , the Marine Band also includes the Marine Chamber Orchestra and Marine Chamber Ensembles . 

The Marine Band is entirely separate from its sister military band , the United States Marine Drum and Bugle Corps ( " The Commandant 's Own " ) and the 10 active duty Marine Corps field bands . 

The Marine Band has been uniquely known as " The President 's Own " since 1801 due to the historic connection to the President of the United States . 

The relationship between the Marine Band and the White House began on New Year 's Day 1801 , when President John Adams invited the band to perform at the Executive Mansion . 

Later that year , Thomas Jefferson initiated the tradition of Marine Band performances by requesting that it perform at his inauguration . 

The Marine Band has played at every United States presidential inauguration since . 

President Thomas Jefferson gave the title " The President 's Own " in 1801 . 

Today , the Marine Band performs in approximately 500 events every year including state funerals , state arrival ceremonies , state dinners , parades , concerts , and other social events . 

The Marine Band also travels across the country each October and November during its fall concert tour , a tradition that began in 1891 under its most famous director , composer John Philip Sousa .
