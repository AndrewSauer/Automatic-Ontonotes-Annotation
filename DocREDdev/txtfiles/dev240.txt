TMF ( The Music Factory ) was a music video and entertainment channel in the United Kingdom and Ireland . 

The channel was owned by Viacom International Media Networks and was originally a Dutch channel . 

Formed after the two other TMF stations , which are based in mainland Europe , the channel was created to counter against EMAP 's The Hits channel ( now 4Music ) on the new free - to - air digital terrestrial television service Freeview in 2002 . 

Upon launch , TMF 's description was " TMF is designed to replicate the rhythms of the whole family , playing the best pop videos with the biggest pop stars to become the sound track to the British family life . " 

However , it had since broadened its content to show programmes from its sister channels MTV , VH1 , Nick Jr. and Comedy Central , so no longer relied on just music videos . 

TMF broadcast on Freeview , Sky and Virgin Media and as well as in some Irish cable packages . 

The channel was the most viewed music video related station in the UK , according to BARB ratings . 

TMF had a new look on screen graphics in March 2008 to match the other British MTV channels . 

The previous on screen graphics were used since July 2005 and the original on screen graphics were used since October 2002 . 

The original DOG was on the top right of the screen , it has been moved to the top left of the screen since July 2005 . 

The new look TMF still used the old pre-2007 TMF logo whereas both the Dutch and Belgian TMF channels adapted the new logo . 

The DOG on music programmes was TMF : Music .
