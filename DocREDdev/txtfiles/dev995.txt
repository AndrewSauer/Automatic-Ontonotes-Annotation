The Essingen Islands are a group of two islands — Stora Essingen and Lilla Essingen — in the Swedish lake of Mälaren , located southwest of Kungsholmen in Stockholm . 

On older maps , the islands are called Stora Hessingen and Lilla Hessingen . 

The islands were a part of the administrative Bromma Parish until 1916 , when they were incorporated with the parish into Stockholm Municipality . 

They remained a part of Bromma ecclesiastical parish until 1955 , when they received their own parish within the Church of Sweden . 

A bridge was built between the islands and Kungsholmen in 1907 , and between the islands themselves in 1917 . 

In 1966 , the Essingeleden motorway opened across the islands . 

The Alviksbron bridge ( for pedestrians , bicycles , and trams ) opened in 2000 .
