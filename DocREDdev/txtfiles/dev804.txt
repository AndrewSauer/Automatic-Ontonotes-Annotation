Breakout is an arcade game developed and published by Atari , Inc. , released on May 13 , 1976 . 

It was conceptualized by Nolan Bushnell and Steve Bristow , influenced by the 1972 Atari arcade game Pong , and built by Steve Wozniak aided by Steve Jobs . 

Breakout was the basis and inspiration for certain aspects of the Apple II personal computer . 

The game was ported to the Atari 2600 and was followed by a 1978 sequel , Super Breakout , which four years later became the pack - in game for the Atari 5200 console . 

Breakout spawned an entire genre of Breakout clones , and the concept found new legs with Taito 's 1986 Arkanoid which itself found dozens of imitators . 

In Breakout , a layer of bricks lines the top third of the screen . 

A ball travels across the screen , bouncing off the top and side walls of the screen . 

When a brick is hit , the ball bounces away and the brick is destroyed . 

The player loses a turn when the ball touches the bottom of the screen . 

To prevent this from happening , the player has a movable paddle to bounce the ball upward , keeping it in play .
