The United States European Command State Partnership Program ( EUCOM SPP ) , according to its own mission , is a National Guard program that " links U.S. states with designated partner countries to ... support the command â€™s security cooperation objectives . " 

Currently , 22 Partnerships exist " with former Soviet , Yugoslav and Warsaw Pact countries in the EUCOM Area of Responsibility . " 

Becoming independent on the dissolution of the Soviet Union on December 26 , 1991 , these countries shortly requested the advice and assistance of the United States in creating new self - defense forces . 

They had been acquired by the Soviet Union from the European Theatre of World War II . 

The requests began among the Baltic states , notably Latvia , which had approached NATO . 

It sent a delegation from five member countries , including the U.S. , which chose the National Guard Bureau as most appropriate spokesman , considering that Latvia could not afford a standing army . 

EUCOM thus became the first of the six geographic Combatant Commands that make up the 

" global SPP , " and the NG , which is divided into state - sized contingents , became the host of each state - sized new national force , typically , but not necessarily , one - to - one , totally voluntarily . 

A country member must begin by requesting membership . 

The very first Partnership Program was with Latvia .
