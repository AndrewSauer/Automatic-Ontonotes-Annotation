The six Cello Suites , BWV 1007 - 1012 , are suites for unaccompanied cello by Johann Sebastian Bach . 

They are some of the most frequently performed and recognizable solo compositions ever written for cello . 

Bach most likely composed them during the period 1717 – 23 , when he served as Kapellmeister in Köthen . 

The title given on the cover of the Anna Magdalena Bach manuscript was Suites à Violoncello Solo senza Basso ( Suites for cello solo without bass ) . 

These suites for unaccompanied cello are remarkable in that they achieve the effect of implied three- to four - voice contrapuntal and polyphonic music in a single musical line . 

As usual in a Baroque musical suite , after the prelude which begins each suite , all the other movements are based around baroque dance types ; the cello suites are structured in six movements each : prelude , allemande , courante , sarabande , two minuets or two bourrées or two gavottes , and a final gigue . 

The Bach cello suites are considered to be among the most profound of all classical music works . 

Wilfrid Mellers described them in 1980 as " Monophonic music wherein a man has created a dance of God . " 

Due to the works ' technical demands , étude - like nature , and difficulty in interpretation because of the non - annotated nature of the surviving copies , the cello suites were little known and rarely publicly performed until they were revived and recorded by Pablo Casals in the early 20th century . 

They have since been performed and recorded by many renowned cellists and have been transcribed for numerous other instruments ; they are considered some of Bach 's greatest musical achievements .
