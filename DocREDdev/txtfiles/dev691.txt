Hang Tuah station is an interchange station in the Pudu district of Kuala Lumpur , Malaysia , between the Ampang and Sri Petaling Lines ( formerly known as STAR ) and the KL Monorail . 

Seamless physical and fare integration was achieved on 1 March 2012 when the " paid - up " or restricted areas of both the LRT and monorail stations , which previously operated as two separate stations , were linked up , allowing passengers to transfer without needing to buy new tickets for the first time since the monorail became operational in 2003 . 

Located on the northwestern tip of Pudu , the station is in the vicinity of the Methodist Boys School , Victoria Institution , the former Pudu Prison , the Hang Tuah police station and the National Stadium .
