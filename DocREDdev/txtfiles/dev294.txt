After the elections Fradique de Menezes joined a new party - the Force for Change Democratic Movement - Liberal Party . 

In the legislative election held on 3 March 2002 , the Independent Democratic Action was the main party in the Uê Kédadji alliance , that won 16.2 % of the popular vote and 8 out of 55 seats .

In the July 2006 presidential election , its leader Patrice Trovoada ran as the only major opposition candidate , but he was defeated by Menezes . 

Trovoada became Prime Minister in February 2008 , but was defeated in a May 2008 vote of confidence proposed by the Movement for the Liberation of São Tomé and Príncipe / Social Democratic Party ( MLSTP / PSD ) , and in June Menezes asked the MLSTP / PSD to form a new government . 

The ADI denounced Menezes ' designation of the MLSTP / PSD to form a government as unconstitutional , arguing that it was too late in the parliamentary term to do so , and it took the matter to the Supreme Tribunal of Justice .
