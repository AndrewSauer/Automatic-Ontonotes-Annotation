The Prime Minister of Thailand is the head of government of the Kingdom of Thailand . 

The prime minister is also the chairman of the cabinet of Thailand and represents the government at home and the country abroad . 

The post of prime minister has existed since 1932 , after a bloodless revolution forced the absolutist King Prajadhipok to grant for the people of Siam their first constitution . 

Under the newly established constitutional monarchy , the first prime minister of Siam was Phraya Manopakorn Nititada . 

At first , the office was called the President of the People 's Committee , it was later changed to Prime Minister of Siam when the king deemed it too communistic . 

Constitutionally the prime minister is required to be a member of the lower house of the National Assembly ( the House of Representatives ) . 

He must also gain their approval through a resolution before an official appointment by the king can take place . 

As a result , the prime minister might succumb to a vote of no confidence and removal in the House . 

However , this has never happened up to date . 

Throughout the post 's existence it has mostly been occupied by military leaders from the Royal Thai Army , three holding the rank of field marshal and seven the rank of general . 

The post of prime minister is currently held by General Prayut Chan - o - cha , who was formally appointed to the office on 24 August 2014 . 

Previously he was the de facto head of government as leader of the National Council for Peace and Order , since the coup d'Ã©tat on 22 May 2014 . 

Note : The list includes leaders of military juntas and acting prime ministers . 

However , they are not counted in the official list as provided by the Royal Thai Government
