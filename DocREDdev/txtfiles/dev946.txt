Souvlaki ( Greek : ) , plural souvlakia , is a popular Greek fast food consisting of small pieces of meat and sometimes vegetables grilled on a skewer . 

It is usually eaten straight off the skewer while still hot . 

It can be served with pita bread , fried potatoes , lemon , and sauces , but the souvlaki itself is eaten on its own , with the side dishes eaten subsequently . 

The meat usually used in Greece and Cyprus is pork , although chicken , beef , and lamb may also be used . 

In other countries ( and for tourists ) , souvlaki may be made with meats such as lamb , beef , chicken , and sometimes fish . 

The word souvlaki is a diminutive of the Medieval Greek σούβλα souvla ' skewer ' , itself borrowed from Latin subula . 

' Souvlaki ' is the common term in Hellenic Macedonia and other regions of northern Greece , while in southern Greece around Athens it is commonly known as ' kalamaki ' , ' reed ' .
