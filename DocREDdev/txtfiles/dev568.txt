The Answer is Never is the second full - length album recorded by the band Howards Alias . 

The album was released by Household Name Records on June 7 , 2004 on compact disc . 

A huge leap in terms of quality of both songwriting and production in comparison to debut The Chameleon Script , this was the sound of a much more mature and less ska punk - influenced Howards Alias . 

As the band had become a quartet by this point , it was up to the multi - talented Nicholas Horne to play both trumpet and trombone during the recording process . 

This added a subtle irony to the fact that the album was touted as being ' closer to the live sound of Howards Alias ' , as did the inclusion of a string instrument section on certain songs . 

Clocking in at just over an hour in length , The Answer is Never is commonly regarded as Howards Alias ' best altogether album . 

The album artwork was provided by UK comic book artist , Chronic Fatigue .
