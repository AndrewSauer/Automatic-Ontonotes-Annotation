Between 2008 and 2011 , the Milton Friedman Institute for Research in Economics was an academic center established at the University of Chicago as a collaborative , cross - disciplinary site for research in economics . 

The Institute aimed to advance , refine , and share research that applied the tools of economic analysis to real - world issues . 

The institute was named in honor of former Chicago economics professor , Milton Friedman , who is widely recognized for his many enduring contributions to economic analysis . 

The institute was a collaboration of the University of Chicago Booth School of Business , Department of Economics , and Law School and fostered inquiry across a wide range of topics and subfields . 

The institute aimed to advance and preserve the unique University of Chicago economic tradition of combining theory and data in rigorous analysis -- an approach exemplified by Friedman and others . 

The Institute hosted visiting scholars working in subfields of economics , business , law , and related fields such as public policy and medicine . 

It hosted workshops , seminars , and lectures on fundamental questions across these fields . 

The Institute also supported advanced professional training for post - doctoral students , as well as expanded opportunities for University of Chicago graduate students . 

When announcing the creation of the institute in 2008 , University President Robert J. Zimmer said its goal was to create " a primary intellectual destination for economics by creating a robust forum for engagement of our faculty and students with scholars and policymakers from around the world . ‚Äù The university had initially planned to invest $ 200 million in the institute , with half of that in the form of an operating endowment ; though the majority of funds were to be raised through donations . 

The institute was an object of intense controversy at the university , as many faculty objected both to its objectives as originally framed and to the naming of an institute after Friedman , who was viewed as polarizing . 

The announcement of the institute drew a response from more than 170 of the faculty at the university , who argued that to found such an institute would constitute " a symbolic endorsement of his views by the University " and that the proposal reflected " a very narrow research scope even within the field of economics , not to speak of the complete disregard for other disciplines involved in the study of ' economy and society ' " . 

In June 2011 , the institute and the Becker Center on Chicago Price Theory were joined to form the new Becker Friedman Institute for Research in Economics .
