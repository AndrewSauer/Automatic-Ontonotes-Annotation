Extreme Makeover : Home Edition ( EM : HE ; sometimes informally referred to as Extreme Home Makeover ) is an American reality television series providing home improvements for less fortunate families and community schools . 

The show was hosted by former model , carpenter and veteran television personality Ty Pennington . 

Each episode features a family that has faced some sort of recent or ongoing hardship such as a natural disaster or a family member with a life - threatening illness , in need of new hope . 

The show 's producers coordinate with a local construction contractor , which then coordinates with various companies in the building trades for a makeover of the family 's home . 

This includes interior , exterior and landscaping , performed in seven days while the family is on vacation ( paid for by the show 's producers ) and documented in the episode . 

If the house is beyond repair , they replace it entirely . 

The show 's producers and crew film set and perform the makeover but do not pay for it . 

The materials and labor are donated . 

Many skilled and unskilled volunteers assist in the rapid construction of the house . 

EM : HE is considered a spin - off of Extreme Makeover , an earlier series providing personal makeovers ( often including plastic surgery ) to selected individuals . 

Unusual for a spin - off , Home Edition outlasted its mother show by several seasons . 

This show displays extreme changes to help recreate someone 's space . 

However , the format differs considerably ; in the original Extreme Makeover , for instance , participants were not necessarily chosen based on any recent hardship , whereas the family 's backstory is an important component of Home Edition . 

EM : HE also has similarities to other home renovation series such as Trading Spaces , on which Pennington was previously a key personality . 

The series was produced by Endemol USA ( the people behind Big Brother , Fear Factor , Deal or No Deal , Wipeout , and other reality shows ) in association with Disney - ABC Television Group 's Greengrass Television . 

The Executive Producers were Brady Connell and George Verschoor . 

The program originally aired on Sunday evenings but was moved to Friday nights as of October 21 , 2011 . 

Upon the airing of its final episode in series form , and for the 2012 special holiday run , it remained ABC 's last series to air solely in standard definition and never converted to a high definition or widescreen presentation . 

On December 15 , 2011 , ABC announced that Extreme Makeover : Home Edition would end its run on January 13 , 2012 . 

It will , however , continue to air as a special on the network .
