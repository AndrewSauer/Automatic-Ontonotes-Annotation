The Blue River is a tributary of the Colorado River , approximately long , in the U.S. state of Colorado . 

It rises in southern Summit County , on the western side of the continental divide in the Ten Mile Range , near Quandary Peak . 

It flows north past Blue River and Breckenridge , then through the Dillon Reservoir near Dillon . 

The West portal for the " Roberts Tunnel " is at the base of Dillon Reservoir . 

The Roberts Tunnel is a trans - basin diversion , built by Denver Water in 1962 , that diverts water under the Continental Divide from the Colorado River basin into the South Plate River Basin . 

The East portal is approximately one mile upstream of Grants , Colorado . 

North of Dillon the river flows NNW along the eastern slope of the Gore Range and joins the Colorado River at Kremmling . 

The Green Mountain Dam , upstream from Kremmling , forms the Green Mountain Reservoir , providing hydroelectric power and diversionary water for irrigation , as part of the Colorado - Big Thompson Project . 

The dam is a project of the United States Bureau of Reclamation .
