The was a 1905 discussion ( not an agreement ) between senior leaders of Japan and the United States regarding the positions of the two nations in greater East Asian affairs , especially regarding the status of Korea and Philippines in the aftermath of Japan 's victory in the Russo - Japanese War . 

It was not an " agreement " and did not set out any new policies , but a memorandum . 

The memorandum was not classified as a secret but no scholar noticed it in the archives until 1924 . 

The discussions were between United States Secretary of War William Howard Taft and Prime Minister of Japan ( Count ) Katsura Tarō on 27 July 1905 . 

The Japanese leader stated Japan 's reasons for its making a protectorate of Korea . 

He repeated that Japan had no interest in the Philippines . 

The US had acquired the Philippines following its victory over Spain in the Spanish – American War of 1898 . 

In 1924 , Tyler Dennett was the first scholar to see the document ; he described it as containing " the text of perhaps the most remarkable ' executive agreement ' in the history of the foreign relations of the United States " . 

The consensus of historians is that Dennett greatly exaggerated the importance of a routine discussion that changed nothing and set no new policies . 

Historians pointed out there was no formal agreement on anything new . 

The word " agreement " in the documents merely means the two sides agreed that the English and Japanese versions of the meeting notes both accurately covered the substance of the conversations . 

President Theodore Roosevelt later agreed that War Secretary Taft had correctly stated the American position . 

When Dennett first discovered the notes he assumed they indicated a highly significant " secret pact " between the US and Japan in creating a basis agreement whereby the two formerly isolationist nations became world powers . 

The conversations regarded the extent of the spheres of influence of Japan and the United States , and maintaining peace between them , in the event of victory of Japan over Russia in the Russo - Japanese War . 

Some Korean historians have assumed that , in the discussions , the United States recognized Japan 's sphere of influence in Korea ; in exchange , Japan recognized the United States ' sphere of influence in the Philippines . 

However , American historians examining official records report no agreement was ever made — the two men discussed current events but came to no new policy or agreement . 

They both restated the well - known official policies of their own governments . 

Indeed , Taft was very careful to indicate these were his private opinions , and he was not an official representative of the U.S. government ( Taft was Secretary of War , not Secretary of State ) .
