Aramis Ayala ( born February 2 , 1975 ) is the State Attorney for the Ninth Judicial Circuit Court of Florida . 

Ayala was elected in November 2016 , and serves as the chief prosecutor . 

Ayala was born in Saginaw , Michigan , and graduated from the University of Michigan with an undergraduate degree . 

She then obtained her law degree from the University of Detroit . 

Controversy arose after she announced she would not seek capital punishment in any case , causing Governor Rick Scott to reassign potential death penalty cases to another State Attorney . 

Ayala has filed lawsuits disputing this action in the Supreme Court of Florida , and in federal court . 

Ayala lost her Supreme Court case against Gov Rick Scott . 

The Florida Supreme Court ruled against Ayala saying the Governor was within his power to take cases away from Ayala because of her position to abandon the death penalty .
