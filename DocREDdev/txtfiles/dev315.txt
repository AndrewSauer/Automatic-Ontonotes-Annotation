The Wedding Dance ( sometimes known as The Dance Village ) is a 1566 oil - on - panel painting by Pieter Bruegel the Elder . 

Owned by the museum of the Detroit Institute of Arts in Detroit , Michigan , the work was discovered by its director in England in 1930 , and brought to Detroit . 

It is believed to be one of a set of three Bruegel works from around the same time , The Wedding Dance , The Peasant Wedding ( 1567 ) and The Peasant Dance ( 1569 ) . 

The painting depicts 125 wedding guests . 

As was customary in the Renaissance period , the brides wore black and men wore codpieces . 

Voyeurism is depicted throughout the entire art work ; dancing was disapproved of by the authorities and the church , and the painting can be seen as both a critique and comic depiction of a stereotypical oversexed , overindulgent , peasant class of the times .
