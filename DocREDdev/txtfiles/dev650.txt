Adolfo Nicolás Pachón ( born 29 April 1936 ) , is a Spanish priest of the Roman Catholic Church . 

He was the thirtieth Superior General of the Society of Jesus , the largest religious order in the Roman Catholic Church . 

Nicolás , after consulting with Pope Francis , determined to resign after his 80th birthday , and initiated the process of calling a Jesuit General Congregation to elect his successor . 

Until the resignation of his predecessor , Peter Hans Kolvenbach , it was not the norm for a Jesuit Superior General to resign ; they , like the great majority of the Popes up until Benedict XVI , generally served until death . 

However , the Jesuit constitutions include provision for a resignation . 

In October 2016 the thirty - sixth General Congregation of the Society of Jesus appointed his successor , Arturo Sosa from Venezuela .
