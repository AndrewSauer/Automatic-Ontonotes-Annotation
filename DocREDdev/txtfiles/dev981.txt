The Reichskommissariat of Belgium and Northern France was a German civil administration ( Zivilverwaltung ) which governed German - occupied Belgium during World War II . 

The Reichskommissariat replaced an earlier military government , the Military Administration in Belgium and Northern France , established in the same territory in 1940 . 

On 18 July 1944 , the first Gauleiter , Josef Grohé , was named the first Reichskommissar of the territory , known as the Reichskommissariat Belgien und Nordfrankreich or Reichskommissariat für die besetzten Gebiete von Belgien und Nordfrankreich . 

The territory was mostly liberated by the Allies in September 1944 , in the aftermath of the Normandy landings , so the existence of the territory was short . 

Following the liberation , the territory was retrospectively annexed directly into Germany ( although no longer under de facto German control ) as three separate Reichsgaue : Reichsgau Flandern , Wallonien and the Brussels district
