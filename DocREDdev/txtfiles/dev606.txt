Radu D. Lecca ( February 15 , 1890 – 1980 ) was a Romanian spy , journalist , civil servant and convicted war criminal . 

A World War I veteran who served a prison term for espionage in France during the early 1930s , he was a noted supporter of antisemitic concepts and , after 1933 , an agent of influence for Nazi Germany . 

While becoming a double agent for Romania 's Special Intelligence Service ( SSI ) , Lecca was involved in fascist politics , gained in importance during World War II and the successive dictatorships , and eventually grew close to Conducător Ion Antonescu . 

After 1941 , Lecca was Commissioner , later Commissioner General , tasked with solving the " Jewish Question " in Romania , sharing Romania 's responsibility for the Holocaust . 

Advised by the special German envoys Manfred Freiherr von Killinger and Gustav Richter and acting with Antonescu 's consent , he established the Central Jewish Office ( Centrala Evreiască , CE ) through which he persecuted , exploited and extorted the Romanian Jewish community , whose existence was threatened by deportations into Transnistria . 

The system he supervised was notoriously corrupt , with many of the funds extorted being used for the personal benefit of Lecca or his political associates . 

Commissioner Lecca was also instrumental in negotiating the Final Solution 's application in Romania , a plan which was eventually abandoned , while considering mass emigration to Palestine in exchange for payments . 

After the August 1944 Coup removed Antonescu and aligned Romania with the Allies , Lecca was among the high - ranking Romanian politicians arrested and transported to the Soviet Union . 

Upon his 1946 return , Lecca was Antonescu 's co - defendant in a People 's Tribunal case , and was condemned to death . 

His sentence was commuted into life imprisonment and later reduced by the communist regime . 

After his release , Lecca wrote memoirs which make various controversial claims , and which minimize his and Antonescu 's participation in Holocaust - related crimes .
