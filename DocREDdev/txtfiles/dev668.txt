Vase de Noces ( also known as Wedding Trough and The Pig Fucking Movie ) a 1974 Belgian avant - garde art exploitation film directed by Thierry ZÃ©no and starring Dominique Garny . 

The film deals openly , and sometimes graphically , with zoophilia . 

It features both real and simulated animal killings and coprophagia , and has been labeled obscene by many sources , notably by the OFLC of Australia . 

The film was banned in Australia by the Australian Classification Board in the mid 1970s with two failed attempts , according to the Australian Classification Board . 

The film went before the Australian Classification Board on April 1 , 1977 , and was banned again for the third time . 

The ban status on the film in Australia has remained largely unchanged since then , due to in part that the film violates Australian obscenity laws .
