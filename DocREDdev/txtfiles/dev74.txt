Tonie Marshall ( born 29 November 1951 ) is a French American actress , screenwriter , and film director . 

After acting in several of Jacques Demy ’s films , including A Slightly Pregnant Man and La Naissance du Jour , Marshall cites to have taken influence from his direction in the sense of creating whimsical atmospheres and rooting the stories with more of a female - centric narrative . 

In her most notable film , Venus Beauty Institute , Marshall ’s touched on the theme of finding love from a female perspective , and how it can fundamentally be more difficult because of how it strays from the traditional dynamic of courtship . 

She explains how “ in a practical sense , it ’s complicated to have abandon [ oneself ] into a man ’s arms and , at the same time , stay very tough because you have to work … ” . 

This carefully expresses the vulnerabilities women endure when heavily committing to relationships , similar to much of Demy ’s work , including The Umbrellas of Cherbourg and The Young Girls of Rochefort .
