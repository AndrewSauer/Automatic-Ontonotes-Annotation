Brooks Pharmacy was a chain of more than 330 pharmacies located throughout New England and New York and has been a well - recognized name in the New England pharmacy industry for several decades . 

The corporate headquarters were located in Warwick , Rhode Island . 

During its heyday in the late 1990s and early 2000s , Brooks was one of the premier regional drug chains in the United States , and was the second largest drug chain in New England , maintaining an especially strong presence in the states of Vermont , New Hampshire , and Rhode Island . 

In 2002 , Brooks was recipient of the 2002 Rex Awards Regional Chain of the Year . 

However , Brooks faced many difficulties between 2004 and 2006 , as its parent company struggled unsuccessfully to integrate 1,500 Eckerd stores acquired from J.C. Penney with the existing Brooks network , resulting in a steady loss of market share and lagging same - store sales as CVS and Walgreens continued to expand and solidify their store base in the New England region . 

In 2007 , Brooks Pharmacy officially announced the sale of the pharmacy to Rite - Aid Pharmacy . 

The Brooks trade name , long associated with New England drug retailing , was retired .
