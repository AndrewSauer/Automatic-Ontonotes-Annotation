The first Battle of Homs was fought on December 10 , 1260 , between the Ilkhanates of Persia and the forces of Egypt , in Syria . 

After the historic Mamluk victory over the Ilkhanates at the Battle of Ain Jalut in September 1260 , Hulagu Khan of the Ilkhanate had the Ayyubid Sultan of Damascus and other Ayyubid princes executed in revenge , thus effectively ending the dynasty in Syria . 

However , the defeat at Ain Jalut forced the Ilkhanate armies out of Syria and the Levant . 

The main cities of Syria , Aleppo and Damascus were thus left open to Mamluk occupation . 

But Homs and Hama remained in the possession of minor Ayyubid princes . 

These princes , rather than the Mamluks of Cairo themselves , actually fought and won the First Battle of Homs . 

Due to the open war between Hulagu and his cousin Berke of the Golden Horde during the civil war of the Mongol Empire , the Ilkhanate could only afford to send 6,000 troops back into Syria to retake control of the lands . 

This expedition was initiated by Ilkhanate generals such as Baidu who was forced to leave Gaza when the Mamluks advanced just before the battle of Ain Jalut . 

After quickly recapturing Aleppo , the force travelled southwards to Homs , but were decisively defeated . 

This ended the first campaign into Syria by the Ilkhanate , though there were several later incursions , none of which ended with conquests lasting more than a year .
