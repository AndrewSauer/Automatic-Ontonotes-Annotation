A lunula ( plural : lunulae ) was a crescent moon shaped pendant worn by girls in ancient Rome . 

Girls ideally wore them as an apotropaic amulet , the equivalent of the boy 's bulla . 

In the popular belief the Romans wore amulets usually as a talisman , to protect themselves against evil forces , demons and sorcery , but especially against the evil eye . 

In Plautus ' play , Epidicus asks the young girl Telestis : " Do n't you remember my bringing you a gold lunula on your birthday , and a little gold ring for your finger ? " 

An explicit definition is provided by Isidore of Seville : " Lunulae are female ornaments in the likeness of the moon , little hanging gold bullae . " 

But in Plautus ' play Rudens , Palaestra says her father gave her a golden bulla on the day of her birth . 

There is also some indication that babies of both sexes wore phallic amulets .
