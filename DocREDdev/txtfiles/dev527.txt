Charles Spurgeon Johnson ( July 24 , 1893 â€“ October 27 , 1956 ) was an American sociologist and college administrator , the first black president of historically black Fisk University , and a lifelong advocate for racial equality and the advancement of civil rights for African Americans and all ethnic minorities . 

He preferred to work collaboratively with liberal white groups in the South , quietly as a " sideline activist , " to get practical results . 

His position is often contrasted with that of W. E. B. 

Du Bois , who was a powerful and militant advocate for blacks and described Johnson as " too conservative . " 

During Johnson 's academic studies and leadership of Fisk University during the 1930s and 1940s , the South had legal racial segregation and Jim Crow discriminatory laws and practices , including having disfranchised most black voters in constitutions passed at the turn of the century . 

Johnson was unwavering in personal terms in his opposition to this oppressive system , yet worked hard to change race relations in terms of short - term practical gains . 

His grandson Jeh Johnson served as the United States Secretary of Homeland Security from 2013 to 2017 .
