Lumia imaging apps are imaging applications by Microsoft Mobile and formerly by Nokia for Lumia devices built on the technology of Scalado ( except for Lumia Panorama which was developed earlier by Nokia originally for Symbian and MeeGo devices ) . 

The Lumia imaging applications were notably all branded with " Nokia " in front of their names , but after Microsoft acquired Nokia 's devices and services business the Nokia branding was superseded with " Lumia " , and often updates included nothing but name changes , but for the Lumia Camera this included a new wide range of feature additions . 

Most of the imaging applications are developed by the Microsoft Lund division . 

As part of the release of Windows 10 Mobile and the integration of Lumia imaging features into the Windows Camera and Microsoft Photos applications some of these applications stopped working in October 2015 .
