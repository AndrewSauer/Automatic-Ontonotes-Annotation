Fyodor Davydovich Kulakov ( ) ( 4 February 1918 â€“ 17 July 1978 ) was a Soviet - Russian statesman during the Cold War . 

Kulakov served as Stavropol First Secretary from 1960 until 1964 , immediately following Nikita Khrushchev 's ouster . 

During his First Secretaryship in Stavropol , Kulakov met Mikhail Gorbachev ; Kulakov became Gorbachev 's mentor , and when he left his Stavropol First Secretaryship to enter national politics , Gorbachev took over his former office . 

Kulakov was elected to several important seats in the 1960s . 

In 1971 , he was elected to the Political Bureau ( Politburo ) . 

He became a leading figure of Soviet leadership , and impressed Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev to such an extent that Western commentators believed that Kulakov would become Brezhnev 's successor . 

This did not happen since Kulakov died in 1978 , four years before Brezhnev .
