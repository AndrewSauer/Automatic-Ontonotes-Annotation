Drossinis Museum is in the center of Kifisia , a northern suburb of Athens , and it is housed in “ Amaryllis ” villa , where Georgios Drossinis lived in his last years and which is named after a central character of one of his earliest and most popular works . 

The museum was founded in 1997 with the aim to preserve and promote Drossinis’ ( 1859 - 1951 ) multidimensional work . 

Drossinis , along with Costis Palamas and Nikos Kampas co - founded the New Athenian School , the Greek literary ‘ 1880s Generation’ , a movement which renewed Greek literature and fought for the establishment of modern Greek language ( " Demotic " ) 

The museum includes three halls , which are on the first floor , while the ground floor houses the Municipal Library of Kifisia , according to Drossinis ’s wish .
