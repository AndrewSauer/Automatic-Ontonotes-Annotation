Georg Riedel ( born 8 January 1934 ) is a Swedish double bass player and composer . 

Riedel migrated to Sweden at the age of four and attended school in Stockholm , including the Adolf Fredrik 's Music School . 

The best known recording featuring Riedel is probably Jan Johansson 's Jazz på svenska ( " Jazz in Swedish " ) , a minimalist - jazz compilation of folk songs recorded in 1962–1963 , though Riedel has recorded with other leading Swedish musicians including trumpeter Jan Allan and Arne Domnérus . 

Riedel 's profile as a composer derives almost exclusively from writing music for Astrid Lindgren movies , including the main theme from the Emil i Lönneberga ( " Emil of Maple Hills " ) movies . 

He also composed the music for several films by Arne Mattsson in the 1960s as well as for film adaptions of novels by Stig Dagerman . 

Riedel also played on Jazz at the Pawnshop in 1977 .
