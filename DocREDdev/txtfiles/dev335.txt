Carol II ( 15 October 18934 April 1953 ) reigned as King of Romania from 8 June 1930 until his coerced abdication on 6 September 1940 . 

Carol was the eldest son of Ferdinand I and became crown prince upon the death of his grand - uncle , King Carol I in 1914 . 

He was the first of the Hohenzollern kings of Romania to be born in the country ( both of his predecessors were born and grew up in Germany and only came to Romania as adults ) . 

Carol , by contrast , spoke Romanian as his first language and was the first member of the Romanian royal family to be raised in the Orthodox faith . 

He possessed a hedonistic personality that contributed to the controversies marring his reign , and his life was marked by numerous scandals , among them marriages to Zizi Lambrino and Princess Helen of Greece and Denmark , daughter of King Constantine I of Greece . 

His continued affairs with Magda Lupescu obliged him to renounce his succession rights in 1925 and leave the country . 

Princess Helen eventually divorced him in 1928 . 

King Ferdinand died in 1927 and Carol 's five - year - old son ascended the throne as Michael I. Carol then returned to Romania in 1930 and replaced his son and the regency that had been in place . 

His reign was marked by re - alignment with Nazi Germany , adoption of anti - semitic laws and ultimately evolved into a personal dictatorship beginning in 1938 . 

On 6 September 1940 , he was forced by his Prime Minister Ion Antonescu to leave the country and withdraw abroad into exile . 

He was succeeded by his son Michael .
