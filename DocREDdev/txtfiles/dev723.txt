Intelligent design ( ID ) is a pseudoscientific argument for the existence of God , presented by its proponents as " an evidence - based scientific theory about life 's origins " . 

Proponents claim that " certain features of the universe and of living things are best explained by an intelligent cause , not an undirected process such as natural selection . " 

ID is a form of creationism that lacks empirical support and offers no testable or tenable hypotheses , so it is not science . 

The leading proponents of ID are associated with the Discovery Institute , a fundamentalist Christian and politically conservative think tank based in the United States . 

Though the phrase " intelligent design " had featured previously in theological discussions of the design argument , the first publication of the term intelligent design in its present use as an alternative term for creationism was in Of Pandas and People , a 1989 creationist textbook intended for high school biology classes . 

The term was substituted into drafts of the book , directly replacing references to creation science and creationism , after the 1987 United States Supreme Court 's Edwards v. Aguillard decision , which barred the teaching of creation science in public schools on constitutional grounds . 

From the mid-1990s , the intelligent design movement ( IDM ) , supported by the Discovery Institute , advocated inclusion of intelligent design in public school biology curricula . 

This led to the 2005 Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District trial in which U.S. District Judge John E. Jones III found that intelligent design was not science , that it " can not uncouple itself from its creationist , and thus religious , antecedents , " and that the school district 's promotion of it therefore violated the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution . 

ID presents two main arguments against evolutionary explanations : irreducible complexity and specified complexity . 

These arguments assert that certain features ( biological and informational , respectively ) are too complex to be the result of natural processes . 

As a positive argument against evolution , ID proposes an analogy between natural systems and human artifacts , a version of the theological argument from design for the existence of God . 

ID proponents then conclude by analogy that the complex features , as defined by ID , are evidence of design . 

Detailed scientific examination has rebutted the claims that evolutionary explanations are inadequate , and this premise of intelligent design — that evidence against evolution constitutes evidence for design — is a false dichotomy . 

It is asserted that ID challenges the methodological naturalism inherent in modern science though proponents concede that they have yet to produce a scientific theory .
