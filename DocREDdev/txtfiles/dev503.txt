Central Massachusetts is the geographically central region of Massachusetts . 

Though definitions vary , most include all of Worcester County and the northwest corner of Middlesex County . 

Worcester , the largest city in the area and the seat of Worcester County , is often considered the cultural capital of the region . 

Other populous cities include Fitchburg , Gardner , Leominster , and arguably Marlborough . 

The region is mostly wooded and hilly upland , in contrast to the Atlantic coastal plain to the east and the Connecticut River valley lowland to the west . 

The geographic center of Massachusetts is located in the town of Rutland . 

The term is seldom used in eastern Massachusetts , where Worcester and points west are instead regarded as part of Western Mass.
