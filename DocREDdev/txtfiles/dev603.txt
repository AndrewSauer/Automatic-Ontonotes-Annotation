Lewis of Luxembourg ( or Louis II de Luxembourg ; died 1443 ) was an Archbishop of Rouen , Bishop of Ely , and Cardinal . 

He was a younger son of John of Luxembourg , Lord of Beauvoir and Marguerite of Enghien . 

Lewis was elected archbishop of Rouen in 1436 . 

He was the leading native administrator / collaborator with the Lancastrian regime in France . 

As its position weakened , his own fortunes and even personal safety became precarious . 

Although the city of Rouen did not fall to Charles VII of France until late 1449 , well after Luxembourg 's death , Henry VI 's government had long ago decided he needed and deserved remuneration and status based more securely in England . 

Thus he was provided to Ely ' in commendam ' on 27 September 1437 . 

This was the fifth wealthiest see in England , yet also amongst the smallest in terms of size or burden . 

He is not known ever to have visited it . 

He died on 18 September 1443 .
