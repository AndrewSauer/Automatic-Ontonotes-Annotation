Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Martinsburg Shops is a historic industrial district in Martinsburg , West Virginia . 

It is significant both for its railroading architecture by Albert Fink and John Rudolph Niernsee and for its role in the Great Railroad Strike of 1877 . 

It consists of three contributing buildings , one of which is the oldest covered roundhouse in the United States . 

The presence of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Company in Martinsburg dates back to the late 1840s , when the first engine and machine shops were erected for the expanding company . 

The shops were designated a National Historic Landmark and placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2003 . 

They are now managed by a local authority as an event venue .
