Wellywood is an informal name for the city of Wellington , New Zealand . 

The name — a conflation of Wellington and Hollywood — is a reference to the film production business established in the city by The Lord of the Rings film director Sir Peter Jackson , and Wellington - based special effects companies Weta Workshop and Weta Digital . 

The businesses operate a number of film - related facilities in the Wellington suburb of Miramar . 

In March 2010 , the Wellington Airport company announced plans to erect a Hollywood - style sign Wellywood on a hillside next to the Miramar cutting . 

After the airport considered a range of alternatives , it was announced in May 2011 that the Wellywood sign would be going ahead . 

However this was met with enormous criticism , and on 1 June 2011 it was announced that a panel would be convened to consider alternative sign options . 

The panel ran a binding public poll on The Dominion Post website with the ' Wellington Blown Away ' design being chosen . 

The sign was erected 27 July 2012 .
