The Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh is the chief executive of the central Indian state of Madhya Pradesh . 

In accordance with the Constitution of India , the governor is a state 's de jure head , but de facto executive authority rests with the chief minister . 

Following elections to the Madhya Pradesh Legislative Assembly , the state 's governor usually invites the party ( or coalition ) with a majority of seats to form the government . 

The governor appoints the chief minister , whose council of ministers are collectively responsible to the assembly . 

Given the confidence of the assembly , the chief minister 's term is for five years and is subject to no term limits . 

Following Madhya Pradesh 's reorganisation on 1 November 1956 , 17 people have served as its chief minister . 

Eleven of these belonged to the Indian National Congress , including the inaugural officeholder Ravishankar Shukla . 

The first non - Congress chief minister was Govind Narayan Singh who defected from the party and lead a Samyukta Vidhayak Dal government from 1967 to 1969 . 

Digvijaya Singh of the Congress became the first officeholder to serve two full five - year terms . 

He was succeeded by Uma Bharti of the Bharatiya Janata Party , Madhya Pradesh 's only woman chief minister . 

Her party - mate Shivraj Singh Chouhan is the current incumbent and the state 's longest - serving chief minister , having held office since November 2005 .
