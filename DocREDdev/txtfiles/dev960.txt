The Faliero Coup was a failed 1355 coup designed to overthrow Venice 's established republican government . 

Strains between the Venetian commoners and the nobility , originally stemming from the catastrophic failure of the nobility in the Battle of Porto - Longo against Venice 's long - time rival , Genoa , are largely considered to be the main cause for the coup . 

However , traditional stories also point to the marriage of Doge Marino Faliero as a possible cause for the coup . 

Faliero , an 81 year old man , had recently taken a young bride , who was rumored to be engaged in multiple affairs , including with Michele Steno , a Venetian statesman and future Doge . 

The consistent rumors and apparent intense arrogance of the established Venetian elite seems to have gotten to Faliero in this explanation for a coup . 

A more reasonable one , however , is that Faliero wished to transform Venice into a dictatorship , mirroring those of Genoa and other northern Italian city - states . 

This view is , however , disputed by some historians , who cite Faliero 's apparent regret at his trial , and , his lack of mentioning his belief that a dictatorship would better suit Venice 's interests , a valid argument . 

These two actions are much more consistent with a man regretting a passionate crime , than one who had executed a calculated plan , some argue . 

The coup was poorly organized and abortive . 

Faliero convened with two popular , wealthy , public figures who also had quarlles with the noblility : Bertuccio Isarello and Filippo Calendario . 

After convincing them of the need for a coup , he laid out his plan : Faliero and Isarello would recruit 20 trusted men who would assist in the overthrow of the government , who would each in turn recruit 40 each . 

However , due to the incredible variability of any given individuals ' reaction to the plan , rumors of unrest quickly began to spread throughout the city and , the Venetian people , fearing the civil turmoil which was swelling up all around them in northern Italy and Byzantium , reported the rumors to the authorities . 

One of the most powerful governmental bodies of Republican Venice , the Council of Ten , soon convened to discuss the rumors . 

They became concerned about the Doge 's role in the plot and , exercising emergency powers , together with the Doge 's councillors , the Signori di Notte , and the six sestieri , ordered the immediate and unquestioned arrest of Calendario and Isarello , who , upon questioning , implicated the Doge . 

After a series of quick albeit somber trials , the conspirators were imprisoned and executed , including Calendario , Isarello , and Doge Faliero .
