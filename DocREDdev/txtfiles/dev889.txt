" Bombtrack " is a song by American rap metal band Rage Against the Machine that opens their self - titled debut album . 

Like most of Rage Against the Machine 's songs , the song 's lyrics discuss social inequality , proclaiming that " landlords and power whores " were going to " burn " . 

The riffs were composed by Rage Against the Machine bassist Tim Commerford . 

The song is one of three on the album in the key of F along with " Know Your Enemy " and " Fistful of Steel " . 

Impressed by their song , Rage Against the Machine named it Bombtrack in reference to hip hop terminology where the word ' bomb ' means ' the greatest ' , making the song title literally mean ' the greatest track ' . 

A music video was released , depicting support for the Peruvian Maoist terrorist organization , Sendero Luminoso and its leader Abimael Guzman . 

The video clip did not appear on the group 's first home video , citing Rage 's first altered political opinion . 

In 2003 , the video finally appeared as bonus material on their Live at the Grand Olympic Auditorium DVD . 

The single artwork features Cuban photographer Alberto Korda 's famous image of Che Guevara , Guerrillero Heroico . 

A mirrored version of the iconic two - tone portrait by Irish artist Jim Fitzpatrick ( T - shirt version ) . 

Perhaps the song 's most notable appearance outside of the music industry would be its appearance in Oliver Stone 's controversial film Natural Born Killers , when Mickey breaks out of his prison cell in search of Mallory .
