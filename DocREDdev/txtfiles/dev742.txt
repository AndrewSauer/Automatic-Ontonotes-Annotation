The Torrejonian North American Stage on the geologic timescale is the North American faunal stage according to the North American Land Mammal Ages chronology ( NALMA ) , typically set from 63,300,000 to 60,200,000 years BP lasting . 

It is usually considered to overlap the Selandian and Thanetian within the Paleocene . 

The Torrejonian is preceded by the Puercan and followed by the Tiffanian NALMA stages . 

The Torrejonian is considered to be contained within the Danian and contains the following substages : 

To3 : Lower boundary source of the base of the Torrejonian ( approximate ) . 

To2 : Lower boundary source of the base of the Torrejonian ( approximate ) and upper boundary source of the base of the Selandian ( approximate ) . 

To1 : Upper boundary source ( 61.7 Ma ) of the base of the Selandian ( approximate ) .
