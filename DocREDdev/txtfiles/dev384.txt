Carl Gösta Björn Joachim von der Esch ( 11 January 1930 – 10 March 2010 ) was a Swedish Christian democratic politician , member of the Riksdag 1998 – 2006 . 

Esch had a farming business and did a Ph.D. in business administration at Uppsala University in 1972 . 

Before joining the Christian Democrats , he had previously represented Moderate Party in the Riksdag 1991 – 1994 , replacing Per Westerberg during his time as a minister . 

At the time of the Swedish 1994 referendum on membership in the European Union , Esch clashed with the Moderate Party as he campaigned on the " no " side . 

When he subsequently formed a list of EU critics that ran in the 1995 European Parliament election in Sweden , he was expelled from the party . 

This list was unsuccessful in the election , and von der Esch returned to parliamentary politics in 1998 as a Christian Democrat . 

In the 2003 referendum on joining the Economic and Monetary Union and the euro , he again campaigned on the " no " side . 

He later joined the June List , became its vice chairman in 2008 , and was on second place on the June List ballot in the 2009 European Parliament election in which the party lost its representation in the European Parliament .
