Lake Hiawatha is located just north of Lake Nokomis in Minneapolis , Minnesota . 

It was purchased by the Minneapolis Park and Recreation Board in 1922 for $ 550,000 . 

At that time the lake was a marsh known as Rice Lake , but over four years , the park system transformed the wetland into a lake surrounded by a park . 

The lake and park have a fishing dock , wading pool , tennis courts , and softball diamonds . 

There is a recreation center that hosts activities . 

The lake borders a municipal golf course . 

In the winter the park sets up ice and hockey rinks . 

There is a bike and walking path starting at Lake Hiawatha which veers onto Lake Nokomis or winds down the Minnehaha Creek right to the mouth of the Minnehaha Falls . 

Lake Hiawatha is one of the few lakes through which Minnehaha Creek flows , and the last one before it reaches Minnehaha Falls and then the Mississippi River . 

Friends of Lake Hiawatha is a community environmental action group that organizes volunteer efforts to clean the lake and park .
