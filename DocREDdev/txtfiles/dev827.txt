Malay houses ( Malay : Rumah Melayu ; Jawi : رومه ملايو ) are traditional dwellings , originating before the arrival of foreign or modern influences , and constructed by the indigenous ethnic Malay of the Malay Peninsula , Sumatra and Borneo . 

Traditional architectural forms , such as tropically - suited roofs and harmonious proportions with decorative elements are considered by traditionalists to still have relevance . 

However traditional buildings require significant maintenance compared to modern construction ; how to preserve wooden materials from the decaying effect of tropical weather as well as termite problems . 

These traditional skills are gradually being lost as Malaysia continues its process of industrialisation , while in Indonesia traditional houses have still survived in rural areas . 

The effort to preserve indigenous architectural styles of Indonesian archipelago has been conducted through documentation and create replicas in provinces pavilions in Taman Mini Indonesia Indah , Jakarta .
