CKNL - FM is a Canadian radio station that broadcasts a mainstream rock format at 101.5 FM in Fort St. John , British Columbia . 

The station is branded as 101.5 The Bear and is owned by Bell Media . 

It is one of three " Bear " rock stations in Canada ; the others are CFBR - FM in Edmonton , Alberta , and CKRX - FM in Fort Nelson , British Columbia . 

The station originally began broadcasting June 20 , 1962 at 970 AM , and later moved to 560 AM and finally to the FM dial at 101.5 FM in 2003 . 

When the FM flip was approved , the station was to continue the country music format of the former 560 CKNL . 

However , likely in response to the recent licensing of CKFU - FM in the same market at that time , when the station flipped to FM the format was switched to a rock station .
