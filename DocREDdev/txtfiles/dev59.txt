Entreat is a live album by British alternative rock band The Cure , recorded at London 's Wembley Arena in July 1989 . 

It consists entirely of songs performed from the band 's 1989 record Disintegration ; while they were on their international Prayer tour . 

Entreat was distributed exclusively in France as a promotional tool . 

When bootlegs began to surface , however , the album was given a limited European release . 

Entreat was also given away free by HMV stores in the UK and Ireland to customers who purchased two CDs from the band 's back catalogue . 

The last two tracks were released in 1989 as B - sides to the US version of " Lullaby " . 

" Fascination Street " , " Last Dance " , " Prayers For Rain " , and " Disintegration " were also included as B - sides on the " Pictures of You " CD single . 

The re - release of Disintegration in 2010 featured a remastered and remixed version of Entreat , entitled Entreat Plus because it featured all twelve songs from the album , including the four excluded from the original . 

It was the first time the album was released worldwide , though it had already been released on CD before .
