Mavis Grind ( or , meaning " gate of the narrow isthmus " ) is a narrow isthmus joining the Northmavine peninsula to the rest of the island of Shetland Mainland in the Shetland Islands , UK . 

It is just wide at its narrowest point . 

It carries the main A970 road to Hillswick in the north west of Shetland and is about two miles west of the settlement of Brae . 

Mavis Grind is said to be the only place in the UK where you can toss a stone across land from the North Sea to the Atlantic Ocean . 

It is a regular crossing point for otters , which in Shetland are sea - dwelling . 

In 1999 , local volunteers successfully helped to demonstrate whether Viking ships could be carried across the isthmus , instead of sailing around the end of the island . 

Remains of a late Bronze Age settlement have been found close by .
