Newsnight is a weekday BBC Television current affairs programme which specialises in analysis and often robust cross - examination of senior politicians . 

The programme 's regular presenters are currently Kirsty Wark and Emily Maitlis . 

Several of the programme 's editors over the years have gone on to senior positions within the BBC and elsewhere . 

Newsnight has been broadcast on BBC Two since 1980 . 

It goes out on weekday evenings between 10:30pm and 11:15pm . 

Occasionally it may have an extended edition if there is an especially significant event in the news â€“ as happened on 7 July 2011 , when the closure of the News of the World led to a programme which continued until 11:35 pm . 

Recent editions are available to view and download for a limited time through the BBC iPlayer . 

A weekly 26-minute digest edition of Newsnight is screened on the corporation 's international channel , BBC World News .
