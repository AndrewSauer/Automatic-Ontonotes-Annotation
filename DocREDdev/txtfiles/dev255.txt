Heinrich LXXII , Prince Reuss of Lobenstein and Ebersdorf ( 27 March 1797â€“17 February 1853 ) was the ruling prince of Reuss - Lobenstein from 7 May 1824 until his abdication on 1 October 1848 , and of Reuss - Ebersdorf from 1822 to 1848 . 

Unlike with most European monarchies , his large regnal number does not indicate that he was preceded by seventy - one previous rulers also named Heinrich . 

By tradition , all male members of the House of Reuss are named Heinrich , and are numbered by order of birth within the family in general . 

In the Reuss Younger Line , the numbering system was reset at the beginning of each century ; thus Heinrich LXXII 's high number is directly related to his having been born at the very end of the eighteenth century . 

Heinrich LXXII abdicated in 1848 , due to civil unrest in connection with the revolutions that spread through Germany and elsewhere in Europe that year . 

The last of his branch of the family , his principality passed to the Prince Reuss zu Schleiz , unifying the lands of the Reuss Younger Line .
