Taiwanese expatriates and descendants in Vietnam consist largely of expatriate businessmen and their families . 

The Ho Chi Minh City branch of the Taipei - based Taiwan External Trade Development Council estimates that 20,000 people from Taiwan were living in Vietnam as of 2002 . 

According to statistics of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees , there are an estimated 3,000 women in Vietnam , formerly married to Taiwanese husbands , who have been left stateless after their divorces ; the women had given up Vietnamese nationality to naturalize as Republic of China citizens at the time of their marriage , but then returned to Vietnam following their divorces and gave up their Republic of China nationality in the process of applying for restoration of Vietnamese nationality . 

Their children , who hold only Republic of China nationality and have never previously been Vietnamese nationals , are ineligible to enter publicly supported schools in Vietnam .
