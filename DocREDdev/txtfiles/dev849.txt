The First Gallagher Ministry is the eleventh ministry of the Government of the Australian Capital Territory , and is led by Labor Chief Minister Katy Gallagher and her deputy Andrew Barr . 

It was appointed as a transitional ministry on 16 May 2011 following the resignation of Jon Stanhope as Chief Minister and the subsequent election of Katy Gallagher as his replacement by the Australian Capital Territory Legislative Assembly . 

The final Stanhope ministry contained five ministers including Stanhope . 

With Stanhope resigning his ministerial posts , the cabinet was reduced to four ministers . 

The new ministry is also the first step in aligning ministerial appointments with the new structure of the ACT public service as recommended by the Hawke Review and adopted by the government . 

To this end , a number of ministerial appointments from the final Stanhope ministry have been consolidated or removed in the new appointments . 

Katy Gallagher has stated that , once the 2011 - 12 ACT Budget is passed by the assembly , she will appoint her deputy Andrew Barr to the Treasury portfolio in her place .
