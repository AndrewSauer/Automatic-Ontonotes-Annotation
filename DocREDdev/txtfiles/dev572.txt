Solar Jetman : Hunt for the Golden Warpship is a multi - directional shooter video game developed by Zippo Games and Rare and published by Tradewest . 

It was released in North America on 14 October 1990 and in Europe on 26 September 1991 for the Nintendo Entertainment System . 

The game is the third instalment of the Jetman series and was later re - released by Nintendo for their NES - based PlayChoice-10 arcade system in the United States in 1990 . 

In the game , series protagonist Jetman must manoeuvre his small craft through caverns of various planets whilst searching for pieces of the Golden Warpship . 

The game is presented in a horizontal side - view environment and has ranging gravitational pulls for each planet , which subjects Jetman 's craft to various forms of inertia . 

Similar to its predecessors , Jetman must keep his craft topped up with fuel in order to progress through levels . 

The game was developed mostly by Mancunian developer Zippo Games under the name of Iota before being ordered to change the game into a Jetman title by Rare . 

Ports of the game for the ZX Spectrum , Commodore 64 and Atari ST were completed but not released due to poor sales of the NES version . 

The game received mostly positive reviews upon release , with critics praising the game 's presentation and graphics , however criticism was directed at the game 's difficulty . 

It was later included in Rare 's 2015 Xbox One retrospective compilation , Rare Replay .
