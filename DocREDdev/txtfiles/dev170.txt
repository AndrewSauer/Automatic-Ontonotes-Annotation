Between Five and Seven is as the name suggests , the sixth studio album by folk singer - songwriter John Gorka . 

It was released in August 1996 . 

It is the last of the five albums Gorka recorded for Windham Hill / High Street Records before returning to the smaller , Red House label . 

Gorka produced the album with John Jennings who also produced Gorka 's previous record , Out of the Valley . 

Unlike the previous record made in Nashville , Tennessee , the recording was done at Paisley Park Studios , Chanhassen , Minnesota and the instrumentation has been described as " more acoustic , less pop - oriented . " 

Paisley Park is southwest of Minneapolis and is the studio designed and owned by the artist , Prince . 

The album includes several lyrical portraits of Gorka 's misfit characters , love songs , and philosophical musings . 

The songs are also full of the wordplay for which Gorka has become known . 

The album features an impressive array of supporting musicians . 

Lucy Kaplansky and Jennifer Kimball add carefully placed harmony vocals to many tracks . 

John Jennings also brings along several other members of Mary Chapin Carpenter 's band including drummer Robbie Magruder , guitarist Dean Magraw , and pianist Jonathan Carroll . 

Gorka 's fellow Minnesotan Peter Ostroushko sits in on mandolin . 

As with many of Gorkas recordings Michael Manring plays fretless bass on nearly half of the songs . 

The tracks alternate between two different sets of instrumentalists which varies the pace of the music . 

The two bass players styles are distinct enough for the listener to recognize the difference .
