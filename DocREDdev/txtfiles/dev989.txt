The perpetual virginity of Mary is a Marian doctrine , taught by the Catholic Church and held by a number of groups in Christianity , which asserts that Mary ( the mother of Jesus ) was " always a virgin , before , during and after the birth of Jesus Christ . " 

This doctrine also proclaims that Mary had no marital relations after Jesus ' birth nor gave birth to any children other than Jesus . 

While the Bible mentions brothers of Jesus , Catholic , Orthodox , and some traditional Protestant interpretations offer various explanations that align with the doctrine of Mary 's perpetual virginity ; that these siblings were either children of Joseph from a previous marriage , cousins of Jesus , or were closely associated with the Holy Family . 

By the fourth century , the doctrine was widely supported by the Church Fathers , and by the seventh century it had been affirmed in a number of ecumenical councils . 

The doctrine is part of the teaching of Catholicism and Anglo - Catholics , as well as Eastern and Oriental Orthodoxy , as expressed in their liturgies , in which they repeatedly refer to Mary as " ever virgin " ( ) . 

The Assyrian Church of the East , which is derived from the Church of the East , also accepts the perpetual virginity of Mary by titling her the " Ever Virgin " , after the " Second Heaven " . 

Some early Protestant reformers such as Martin Luther supported the doctrine , and founder figures of Anglicanism such as Hugh Latimer and Thomas Cranmer " followed the tradition that they had inherited by accepting Mary as ' ever virgin ' " . 

Reformed teaching , however , largely abandoned it . 

The doctrine of perpetual virginity is currently maintained by some Anglican and Lutheran theologians . 

In addition , John Wesley , the founder of Methodism , affirmed the perpetual virginity of Mary .
