Franz Wilhelm Seiwert ( March 9 , 1894 – July 3 , 1933 ) was a German painter and sculptor in a constructivist style . 

He was also politically active as a communist making significant contributions , both graphic and theoretical to Die Aktion . 

Seiwert was born in Cologne . 

He was seriously burned in 1901 , at the age of seven , in an experimental radiological treatment . 

As a result , he subsequently lived with the fear that his life would be short . 

He studied from 1910 to 1914 at the Cologne School of Arts and Crafts . 

In 1919 he met Max Ernst and took part in Dada activities . 

He was invited to exhibit in the large Dada exhibit in Cologne but withdrew at the last moment . 

In that same year he formed the Stupid group which included Heinrich Hoerle and Anton Räderscheidt . 

According to Ernst , " Stupid was a secession from Cologne Dada . 

As far as Hoerle and especially Seiwert were concerned , Dada 's activities were aesthetically too radical and socially not concrete enough " . 

His first large solo exhibition was in Cologne at the Kunstverein in 1923 , and by the mid-1920s he was a leader of the " Group of Progressive Artists " , who sought to reconcile constructivism with realism while expressing radical political views . 

In 1929 he founded the magazine " a - z " , a journal of progressive art . 

This became a vehicle for the exposition of Figurative Constructivism .
