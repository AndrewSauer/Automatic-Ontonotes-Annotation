American Theocracy : The Peril and Politics of Radical Religion , Oil , and Borrowed Money in the 21st Century ( ) is a 2005 political commentary book by American political writer Kevin Phillips . 

The book is a critique of the past forty years of the Republican coalition in United States politics . 

He " presents a nightmarish vision of ideological extremism , catastrophic fiscal irresponsibility , rampant greed , and dangerous shortsightedness . " 

Phillips points to three unifying themes holding this coalition together . 

First , its tie to oil and the role oil plays in American and world events . 

Second , to the coalition of social conservatives , Evangelicals and Pentecostals in this Republican coalition . 

Finally , he points to the " debt culture " of this coalition , and to a coming " debt bubble " related to the debt of the U.S. Government and U.S. consumers . 

He argues that similar issues have been prevalent in the past , when other world powers , such as the Roman Empire and the British Empire declined from their peaks and fell into disarray . 

While working as a strategist in the presidential campaign of Richard Nixon , Phillips wrote The Emerging Republican Majority . 

In that book , Phillips predicted the formation of this very coalition that he criticizes in his current book . 

In American Theocracy he admits that while these " mutations , " as he calls them , could have been predicted , he did not foresee the extent to which they would develop and dominate the coalition he helped put together . 

The last chapter of this book references his first work , and is called " The Erring Republican Majority . "
