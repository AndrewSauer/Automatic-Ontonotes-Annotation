Bill French ( born 1941 , United States ) , known by the pseudonym Bill Warner , is a critic of Islam , a writer and the founder of the Center for the Study of Political Islam . 

He is a former Tennessee State University physics professor . 

He is listed by the Southern Poverty Law Center as part of a core group of 10 Anti - Muslim hard - liners . 

Warner has said that his focus is on the political aspects of Islamic doctrine related to kafirs ( non - Muslims ) rather than on the beliefs of contemporary Muslims . 

His books are based on the premise that Islam as a religion and what he refers to as Political Islam should be clearly delineated . 

Islam as a faith is an individual â€™s private decision and it should be treated with respect and tolerance . 

Warner defines " political Islam , " which he also calls Islamism , " as a belief that Islam should control society and politics , not simply personal religious life . "
