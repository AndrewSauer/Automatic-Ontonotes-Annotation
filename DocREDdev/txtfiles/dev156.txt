The Young Wild Things Tour was a four - band fall 2007 arena concert tour by Fall Out Boy with supporting acts Gym Class Heroes , Plain White T 's , Cute Is What We Aim For , and Doug ( from November 9 on ) . 

This is Fall Out Boy 's biggest tour to date , grossing over $ 30 million . 

The tour sold out in five hours , with over 1.5 million tickets sold . 

The tour was first announced on the Fall Out Boy website , but instead of the traditional method of announcing tour dates in the same release as the announcement of the tour itself , the bands chose an unusual method . 

Fans would text a certain number and would be given a code for their state / area . 

That code would then be entered on a website . 

After an unknown amount of codes were entered , the tour date would be unlocked . 

The 31-date tour was only held in America , except for two Canadian dates . 

The tour began on October 18 and ran through December 2 . 

Inspired by Maurice Sendak 's 1963 children 's book Where the Wild Things Are , the concert tour included sets designed by artist Rob Dobi , containing images from the book . 

Fall Out Boy bassist Pete Wentz explained , " Where the Wild Things Are is a great narrative . 

It encapsulates pretty much every FOB song ever written : You know , tantrums and monster islands and all . " 

" There 's also a play on words of the young wild thing idea that everybody has with Hollywood and starlets right now . "
