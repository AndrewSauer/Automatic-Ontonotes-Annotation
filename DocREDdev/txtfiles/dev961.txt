Cornelis or Cornelius Ketel ( 18 March 1548 â€“ 8 August 1616 ) was a Dutch Mannerist painter , active in Elizabethan London from 1573 to 1581 , and in Amsterdam from 1581 to the early 17th century , now known essentially as a portrait - painter , though he was also a poet and orator , and from 1595 began to sculpt as well . 

According to Ketel 's biography , written by his contemporary Karel van Mander , he seems to have wanted to concentrate on the most prestigious of the hierarchy of genres , history painting , which included mythological subjects , but after he left France he is known almost entirely as a portrait - painter . 

Neither England nor Holland had much demand for large history paintings during his lifetime , and none of Ketel 's histories or allegorical paintings are known to have survived intact , although drawings and prints survive . 

He did however significantly influence the development of the largest type of painting commonly produced in the United Provinces at this period , the civic group portrait .
