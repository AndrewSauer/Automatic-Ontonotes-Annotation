Chachalacas are galliform birds from the genus Ortalis . 

These birds are found in wooded habitats in far southern United States ( Texas ) , Mexico , and Central and South America . 

They are social , can be very noisy and often remain fairly common even near humans , as their relatively small size makes them less desirable to hunters than their larger relatives . 

As invasive pests , they have a ravenous appetite for tomatoes , melons , beans , and radishes and can ravage a small garden in short order . 

They travel in packs of six to twelve . 

They somewhat resemble the guans , and the two have commonly been placed in a subfamily together , though the chachalacas are probably closer to the curassows . 

The generic name is derived from the Greek word όρταλις , meaning " pullet " or " domestic hen . " 

The common name is an onomatopoeia for the four - noted cackle of the plain chachalaca ( O. vetula ) . 

Mitochondrial and nuclear DNA sequence data tentatively suggest that the chachalacas emerged as a distinct lineage during the Oligocene , somewhere around 40–20 mya , possibly being the first lineage of modern cracids to evolve ; this does agree with the known fossil record – including indeterminate , cracid - like birds – which very cautiously favors a north - to - south expansion of the family .
