The album discography of the Cuban - American singer Gloria Estefan consists of twenty studio albums , nine compilations , and seven EPs ( combining Estefan 's releases with her band , the Miami Sound Machine , and her solo releases ) . 

With estimated sales of 100 million of albums worldwide , she and Selena Quintanilla are the most successful female Latin crossover artists ever . 

Although they had been recording since the mid-1970s , Estefan 's breakthrough came when Miami Sound Machine released the single " Dr. 

Beat " in Europe in 1984 . 

Though a major hit there , the band did n't make a commercial impact in the United States until the following year with the release of the single , " Conga " , which became a signature - song for Estefan . 

Both of the corresponding albums ( Eyes of Innocence and Primitive Love ) were credited to Miami Sound Machine . 

Their next album , 1987 's Let It Loose ( titled as Anything For You in Europe ) was credited to Gloria Estefan and Miami Sound Machine . 

All further albums after 1989 's Cuts Both Ways onwards were credited solely to Estefan herself , though Miami Sound Machine continues to be her backing band and perform with her live to the present day . 

Estefan has also recorded many albums in Spanish , and her 1993 album , Mi Tierra , is one of the most successful Spanish - language albums released in the USA . 

The album was also an international hit and became the first album in Spain to gain a Diamond certification ( for sales in excess of 1 million copies ) .
