Cy Becker is a neighbourhood in northeast Edmonton , Alberta , Canada and named after one of Alberta 's first bush pilots and finest wartime flying aces , Cy Becker staked his claim in history by making the first air mail delivery to remote northern communities . 

Since then , in recognition of his contributions and those of many others , the City of Edmonton has identified an area in Edmonton 's northeast side as Pilot Sound . 

Subdivision and development of the neighbourhood will be guided by the Cy Becker Neighbourhood Structure Plan ( NSP ) once adopted by Edmonton City Council . 

It is located within Pilot Sound and was originally considered Neighbourhood 5 within the Pilot Sound Area Structure Plan ( ASP ) . 

Cy Becker is bounded on the west by the McConachie neighbourhood , north by Anthony Henday Drive , east by the future Gorman neighbourhood , and south by the Brintnell and Hollick - Kenyon neighbourhoods . 

The community is represented by the Horse Hill Community League , established in 1972 .
