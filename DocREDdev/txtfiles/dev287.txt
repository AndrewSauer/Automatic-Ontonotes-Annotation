Many units of the United States Armed Forces have distinctive mottoes . 

Such mottoes are used in order to " reflect and reinforce " each unit 's values and traditions . 

Mottoes are used by both military branches and smaller units . 

While some mottoes are official , others are unofficial . 

Some mottoes appear on unit patches , such as the U.S. Army 's distinctive unit insignia . 

The use of mottoes is old as the U.S. military itself . 

A general order issued by George Washington on February 20 , 1776 , when he was commander - in - chief of the Continental Army , directed that " it is necessary that every Regiment should be furnished with Colours " and the " Number of the Regiment is to be mark'd on the Colours , and such a Motto , as the Colonel may choose , in fixing upon which , the General advises a Consultation amongst them .
