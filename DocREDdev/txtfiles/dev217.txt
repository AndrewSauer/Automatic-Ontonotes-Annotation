The Philippine Commission was the name of two bodies , both appointed by the President of the United States to assist with governing the Philippines . 

The first Philippine Commission was appointed by President William McKinley on January 20 , 1899 to make recommendations . 

The second Philippine Commission , also known as the Taft Commission , was a body appointed by the President to exercise legislative and limited executive powers in the Philippines . 

It was first appointed by President McKinley in 1900 under his executive authority . 

The Philippine Organic Act was passed by the United States Congress in 1902 ; this enshrined into law the Commission 's legislative and executive authority . 

As stipulated in the Philippine Organic Act , the bicameral Philippine Legislature was established in 1907 , with the Commission as the upper house and the elected Philippine Assembly acting as lower house . 

The Jones Act of 1916 ended the Commission , replacing it with an elected Philippine Senate as the Legislature 's upper house .
