" Ne crois pas " ( , Do n't believe ) is a song that was performed in the Eurovision Song Contest 1956 by French singer Michèle Arnaud . 

It was the first of two Luxembourgish entry in the contest and was performed in French . 

In contrast to most of the other entries of this Contest , the song is an up - tempo number , with Arnaud telling a friend or lover that the fact that he looks good at the moment is largely meaningless . 

She tells him that his looks are due to his youth and that , as for the rest of humanity , he will lose his hair , gain weight and possibly lose his teeth as well . 

Thus , she tells him that he should " take advantage of it " , rather than simply enjoying his looks at the time . 

The song was performed sixth on the night ( following France 's Mathé Altéry with " Le temps perdu " and preceding Italy 's Franca Raimondi with " Aprite le finestre " ) . 

As the scoreboard of this Contest has never been released , definitive statements about scores and positions are impossible to make , however the song did not win . 

The song was accompanied at the 1956 contest by Arnaud with " Les amants de minuit " and was succeeded as Luxembourgish representative at the 1957 contest by Danièle Dupré with " Amours mortes ( tant de peine ) " .
