The Enterprise Objects Framework , or more commonly simply EOF , was introduced by NeXT in 1994 as a pioneering object - relational mapping product for its NeXTSTEP and OpenStep development platforms . 

EOF abstracts the process of interacting with a relational database by mapping database rows to Java or Objective - C objects . 

This largely relieves developers from writing low - level SQL code . 

EOF enjoyed some niche success in the mid-1990s among financial institutions who were attracted to the rapid application development advantages of NeXT 's object - oriented platform . 

Since Apple Inc 's merger with NeXT in 1996 , EOF has evolved into a fully integrated part of WebObjects , an application server also originally from NeXT . 

Many of the core concepts of EOF re - emerged as part of Core Data , which further abstracts the underlying data formats to allow it to be based on non - SQL stores .
