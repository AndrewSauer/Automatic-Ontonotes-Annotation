Cassels Lake ( originally known as White Bear Lake ) is a lake located within the Municipality of Temagami , in the Nipissing District , Ontario , Canada . 

It contains numerous portages , campsites and is one of three lakes on the eastern edge of the White Bear Forest . 

In the 1920s a log dam was constructed at the narrows connecting Cassels Lake and Rabbit Lake to float logs from the surrounding area out to the Ottawa River . 

The water level in numerous lakes close to Temagami was increased numerous feet . 

The Gillies ' Bros. logging company then cut the trees from the land and the flooded forest area leaving behind the snags and stumps seen in the water . 

The old growth white pine and red pine immediately south of the mill was never cut and remains today as the 400-year - old White Bear Forest . 

According to local folklore , this stand was n't cut because the wife of the mill manager wanted to look out of her home on the majestic pine forest , and so forbid him from cutting there . 

The White Bear Forest on the south side of the lake , opposite the former mill , is now a conservation reserve . 

The reserve has a system of hiking trails , which provide visitors with a great opportunity to experience the old growth pine forest .
