Yi Seok ( born 3 August 1941 ) is the nominal King of Joseon as the head of the House of Yi , the Korean royal family . 

He was described as " the last prince still living on Korean soil , the last pretender to an abolished throne " by The New York Times . 

Yi gained fame as the " singing prince " with the wedding favorite " Pigeon House " , released in 1967 . 

Since 2004 , he has been employed by the city of Jeonju to promote tourism . 

He is also a professor of history at Jeonju University . 

He is a son of Prince Yi Kang , the fifth son of Emperor Gojong of Korea , and his thirteenth wife , Lady Hong Ch≈èng - sun , a former telephone operator . 

Currently , Yi Seok resides in a building renovated for his use by the city of Jeonju , 243 kilometers south of Seoul . 

The city government hopes that Seok 's settlement on the grounds of its Hanok Village will spotlight the historic significance of the city and help it to attract tourists . 

As part of this arrangement , Seok gives lectures to Jeonju visitors about Korean history . 

He also frequently lectures elsewhere and is often called upon for ceremonial duties , despite his official status as a private citizen . 

Recently , Seok authored a book about the late Joseon Dynasty royal court family and has founded an organization , which he now leads , " The Imperial Grandson Association " , dedicated to preserving the culture of the royal court . 

The Republic of Korea owned website , Korea.net , recognizes King Yi Seok as the only remaining heir in Korea .
