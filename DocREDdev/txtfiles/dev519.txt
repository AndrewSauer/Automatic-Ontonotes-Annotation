The Winnebago War , also known as the Winnebago Uprising , was a brief conflict that took place in 1827 in the Upper Mississippi River region of the United States , primarily in what is now the state of Wisconsin . 

Not quite a war , the hostilities were limited to a few attacks on American civilians by a portion of the Winnebago ( or Ho - Chunk ) Native American tribe . 

The Ho - Chunks were reacting to a wave of lead miners trespassing on their lands , and to false rumors that the United States had sent two Ho - Chunk prisoners to a rival tribe for execution . 

Most Native Americans in the region decided against joining the uprising , and so the conflict ended after U.S. officials responded with a show of military force . 

Ho - Chunk chiefs surrendered eight men who had participated in the violence , including Red Bird , who American officials believed to be the ringleader . 

Red Bird died in prison in 1828 while awaiting trial ; two other men convicted of murder were pardoned by President John Quincy Adams and released . 

As a result of the war , the Ho - Chunk tribe was compelled to cede the lead mining region to the United States . 

The Americans also increased their military presence on the frontier , building Fort Winnebago and reoccupying two other abandoned forts . 

The conflict convinced some officials that Americans and Indians could not live peaceably together , and that the Natives should be compelled to move westward , a policy known as Indian removal . 

The Winnebago War preceded the larger Black Hawk War of 1832 , which involved many of the same people and concerned similar issues .
