Newell Convers Wyeth ( October 22 , 1882 – October 19 , 1945 ) , known as N. C. Wyeth , was an American artist and illustrator . 

He was the pupil of artist Howard Pyle and became one of America 's greatest illustrators . 

During his lifetime , Wyeth created over 3,000 paintings and illustrated 112 books , 25 of them for Scribner 's , the Scribner Classics , which is the work for which he is best known . 

The first of these , Treasure Island , was one of his masterpieces and the proceeds paid for his studio . 

Wyeth was a realist painter just as the camera and photography began to compete with his craft . 

Sometimes seen as melodramatic , his illustrations were designed to be understood quickly . 

Wyeth , who was both a painter and an illustrator , understood the difference , and said in 1908 , " Painting and illustration can not be mixed — one can not merge from one into the other . " 

He is the father of Andrew Wyeth and the grandfather of Jamie Wyeth , both known American painters .
