Eudes was an ardent proponent of the Sacred Hearts and dedicated himself to its promotion and celebration ; the Masses he compiled for both Sacred Hearts were later said for the first time both in his lifetime . 

He preached missions across France including Paris and Versailles while becoming known as a popular evangelist as well as a sought - out confessor and preacher . 

Father Eudes was also a prolific writer and wrote on the Sacred Hearts while also condemning the Jansenists in favour of full support for the pope . 

Eudes was canonized as a saint in mid-1925 and there is a current push to have him named as a Doctor of the Church .
