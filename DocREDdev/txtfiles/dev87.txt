The Riksakten was the 1815 Act of Union that regulated the terms of the constitutional personal union between Sweden and Norway established in 1814 . 

The fundamental documents of the union were only the Convention of Moss and the revised Norwegian constitution of 4 November 1814 . 

The Norwegian constitution had been adapted to the union before it was entered into , but the Swedish one was never adjusted correspondingly . 

The conservative Swedish Riksdag had not allowed the Swedish constitution of 1809 to be revised . 

Therefore , a bilateral treaty had to be negotiated in order to clarify procedures for treating constitutional questions that had to be decided jointly by both governments . 

The Act of Union ( Riksakten ) was negotiated during the spring of 1815 , with prime minister Peder Anker leading the Norwegian delegation . 

The treaty contained twelve articles dealing with the king 's authority , the relationship between the two legislatures , how the executive power was to be exercised if the king should die before the crown prince had attained majority , and the relationship between the cabinets . 

It also confirmed the practice of treating questions of foreign policy in the Swedish cabinet , with the Norwegian prime minister present . 

Vital questions pertaining to the Union were to be treated in a joint cabinet meeting , where all the Norwegian ministers in Stockholm would be present . 

The Act was passed by the Storting 31 July 1815 and by the Riksdag 6 August , and sanctioned by the king on 15 August . 

In Sweden the Act of Union was a set of provisions under regular law , but the Norwegian Storting gave it constitutional status , so that its provisions could only be revised according to the procedures laid down in the constitution . 

The Riksakten contained 12 paragraphs :
