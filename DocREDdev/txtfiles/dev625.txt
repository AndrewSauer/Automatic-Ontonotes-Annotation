The state of Prussia had its origins in the separate lands of the Margraviate of Brandenburg and of the Duchy of Prussia . 

The Margraviate of Brandenburg developed from the medieval Northern March of the Holy Roman Empire , passing to the House of Hohenzollern in 1415 . 

The Duchy of Prussia originated in 1525 when Albert of Brandenburg - Ansbach , a member of a cadet branch of the Hohenzollerns , secularized the eastern lands of the Teutonic Knights as a Polish fief . 

Prince - elector John Sigismund , Elector of Brandenburg , inherited the Duchy of Prussia in 1618 , thus uniting Brandenburg and Prussia under one ruler in a personal union ; the Elector 's state became known as Brandenburg - Prussia . 

The Kingdom of Prussia formed when Elector Frederick III assumed the title of Frederick I , King in Prussia , on 18 January 1701 . 

Hohenzollern monarchical rule of Prussia ceased in 1918 after the fall of the German Empire in the aftermath of World War I ; the Kingdom becoming instead the Free State of Prussia . 

The Allied Control Council decreed the formal abolition of the state of Prussia in 1947 following World War II .
