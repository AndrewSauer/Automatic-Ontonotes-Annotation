The Shanghainese language , also known as the Shanghai dialect , Hu language or Hu dialect , is a variety of Wu Chinese spoken in the central districts of the City of Shanghai and its surrounding areas . 

It is classified as part of the Sino - Tibetan language family . 

Shanghainese , like other Wu variants , is mutually unintelligible with other varieties of Chinese , such as Mandarin . 

Shanghainese belongs to the Taihu Wu subgroup , and contains vocabulary and expressions from the entire Taihu Wu area of southern Jiangsu and northern Zhejiang . 

With nearly 14 million speakers , Shanghainese is also the largest single form of Wu Chinese . 

It serves as the lingua franca of the entire Yangtze River Delta region . 

Shanghainese is rich in vowels ( twelve of which are phonemic ) and in consonants . 

Like other Taihu Wu dialects , Shanghainese has voiced initials : neither Cantonese nor Mandarin has voiced initial stops or affricates . 

The Shanghainese tonal system is also significantly different from other Chinese varieties , sharing more similarities with the Japanese pitch accent , with two level tonal contrasts ( high and low ) , whereas Cantonese and Mandarin are typical of contour tonal languages .
