The history of Panama during World War II begins in 1939 . 

Due to the American - controlled Panama Canal cutting across the center of the country , Panama was of major strategic importance to the Allied war effort , as well as the most important strategic location in Latin America during World War II . 

It provided an invaluable link between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans that was vital to both commerce and the defense of the Western Hemisphere . 

Therefore , the defense of the Canal Zone was the United States ' chief concern in the American Theater . 

Panama never received Lend - Lease assistance , but in return for the rights to build military infrastructure within Panamanian territory , the United States undertook large - scale public works projects , which did much to modernize the country and boost the economy .
