Spain was an important center of knowledge during the medieval era . 

While most of western and southern Europe suffered from the collapse of the Roman Empire , although declining , some regions of the former empire , Hispania ( the Iberian Peninsula ) , southern Italy , and the remainder of the Eastern Roman Empire or Byzantine Empire , did not to suffer from the full impact of the so - called Dark Ages when education collapsed with the collapse of the empire and most knowledge was lost . 

The Islamic conquests of places such as Egypt , which was a major part of the Byzantine Empire , and other places which were centers of knowledge in earlier times , gave the Muslims access to knowledge from many cultures which they translated into Arabic and recorded in books for the use of their own educated elites , who flourished in this period , and took with them to the Hispania after it fell under Muslim control . 

Much of this knowledge was later translated by Christian and Jewish scholars in the Christian kingdoms of the Reconquista from Arabic into Latin , and from there it spread through Europe .
