The National Executive Committee of the African National Congress is the chief executive organ of the South African political party , the African National Congress . 

It is elected at every National Conference ; the executive committee , in turn , elects a National Working Committee for day - to - day decision - making responsibilities . 

On 22 September 2008 , ANC chose deputy leader Kgalema Motlanthe to replace Thabo Mbeki as president until at least April 2009 , when new elections will be held . 

ANC parliamentary caucus Spokesman KK Khumalo said : " Motlanthe will be the president , not interim , he will be the president of the republic until the election . " 

The South African constitution provides that " parliament elects the president from among its members , dominated by the ANC since 1994 . "
