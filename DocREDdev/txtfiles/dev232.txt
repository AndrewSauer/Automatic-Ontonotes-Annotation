Consort Mei ( died 755 ) was an imperial consort of the Chinese dynasty Tang Dynasty during the reign of Emperor Xuanzong of Tang . 

She was one of Emperor Xuanzong 's favorite concubine , often known as Mei fei ( with fei being a standard rank for imperial consorts during her lifetime ) . 

Her actual name was Jiang Caipin ( 江采蘋 ) , originally called Consort Jiang . 

After being told by her that she greatly favored Plum - Blossom flowers ( the flower is pronounced as mei in Chinese ) , Emperor Xuanzong began to fondly address her as Consort Mei . 

Consort Mei was initially selected by Gao Lishi , an eunuch official of Emperor Xuanzong , to become one of Emperor Xuanzong 's concubines in his harem . 

As Consort Mei was the most literate and talented concubines , she soon obtained Xuanzong 's favors . 

To express the favors towards Consort Mei , Xuanzong commanded servants to plant Plum - Blossom trees all around her palace to please her interest . 

Xuanzong even lovingly complimented her beauty as more adorable than Zhao Feiyan , and swore that he would never change his heart for her . 

However , in 737 , after the death of Consort Wu , another favorite concubine of Xuanzong , Xuanzong was deeply depressed until Gao Lishi convinced him to try looking at Yang Yuhuan - the wife of prince Li Mao , Xuanzong son with Consort Wu since her beauty was described as the most " irresistible " . 

Being curious , Xuanzong ordered Yang Yuhuan to come and subsequently fell in love with her beauty . 

Since Yuhuan was still literally his daughter - in - law ( as she was Li Mao 's wife ) , emperor Xuanzong then stealthily arranged Yuhuan to become a Taoist nun , after a brief moment , Xuanzong eventually offered Yuhuan honorable title as Yang Guifei ( with Guifei being the highest rank for imperial consorts ) after bestowing his son Li Mao a new wife . 

Yuhuan became Xuanzong 's most beloved consort as Xuanzong soon forgot about Consort Wu 's death . 

His favors towards Consort Mei also waned . 

In 755 , An Lushan began to create a rebellion ( known as An Lushan Rebellion ) in the palace . 

Emperor Xuanzong decided to bring Yang Guifei and his cortege along to flee from the capital Chang'an to Chengdu . 

Consort Mei was left behind then murdered during the rebellion .
