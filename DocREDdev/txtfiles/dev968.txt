Panlongcheng ( ) or Panlong City is an archaeological site associated with the Erligang culture . 

The site is located just north of the Yangtze river in Huangpi , Wuhan , Hubei , China . 

Panlongcheng is the largest excavated Erligang site ( 1   km² at its peak ) , showing the southernmost reach of the Erligang culture at its peak . 

It was discovered in 1954 , and excavated in 1974 and 1976 . 

The site at Panlongcheng was sparsely inhabited during the Erlitou period , consisting mainly of several small settlements and occupying an area of around 200,000 m² . 

During the early Erligang period , the site suddenly grew rapidly , reaching an area of around with a walled center of 75,000 m² . 

Panlongcheng may have been an Erligang outpost used to control regional resources , such as copper mines . 

The construction and bronze casting techniques at Panlongcheng are identical with the techniques employed at Erligang and Zhengzhou ; however , the pottery style is different . 

The style of Erligang elite burials is almost an exact replica of the burials at Zhengzhou ; however , later layers show that the Erligang style disappeared during the later stages of the Erligang culture . 

The site declined until it was abandoned altogether at the end of the Erligang culture . 

Panlongcheng 's decline may have been affected in part by the growth of the site at Wucheng . 

In Hubei Province , other sites such as Jingnansi and Baimiaozhu also feature Erlitou or Late Erlitou – Early Erligang type of ceramics .
