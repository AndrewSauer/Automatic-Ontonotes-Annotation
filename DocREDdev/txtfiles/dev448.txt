The Des Plaines River ( ) is a river that flows southward for through southern Wisconsin and northern Illinois in the United States Midwest , eventually meeting the Kankakee River west of Channahon to form the Illinois River , a tributary of the Mississippi River . 

Native Americans used the river as transportation route and portage . 

When French explorers and missionaries arrived in the 1600s , in what was then the Illinois Country of New France , they named the waterway La Rivi√®re des Plaines ( River of the Plane Tree ) as they felt that trees on the river resembled the European plane tree . 

The local Native Americans showed these early European explorers how to traverse waterways of the Des Plaines watershed to travel from Lake Michigan to the Mississippi River and its valley .
