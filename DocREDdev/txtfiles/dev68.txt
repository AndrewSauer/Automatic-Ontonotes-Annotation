Manon Balletti ( 1740 – 1776 ) was the daughter of Italian actors performing in France and lover of the famous womanizer Giacomo Casanova . 

She was ten years old when she first met him ; she happened to be the daughter of Silvia Balletti , an actress of the Comédie Italienne company and younger sister of Casanova 's closest friend . 

The lovers started their relationship when Casanova was thirty - two years old and Manon was seventeen . 

( Although Manon 's mother was associated with acting , considered disreputable at the time , mother and daughter were observed by Casanova to be of a " pure nature " . ) 

She wrote forty - two letters full of love and deep feelings for him ; a well - known quote from these letters describes Casanova as : " My lover , my husband , my friend " . 

Casanova 's sexual passions caused him to be unfaithful , causing their three - year relationship to have numerous ups and downs . 

Yet she continued to share his home , found in Rue du Petit - Lion - St . Sauveur . 

Manon was at the time engaged to her clavichord teacher , but broke it off at Casanova 's request , thus starting a new engagement with him . 

This did not keep him from having various sexual relations with other women , yet Manon remained faithful to him . 

His memoirs record his regret for being unkind to her when having these affairs . 

Once Casanova was imprisoned after he was sued by creditors in Paris . 

Manon sent a pair of diamond earrings with which she bought him out . 

Subsequently she ended the engagement and returned his portrait and letters . 

Manon married the architect Jacques - François Blondel a short while after , disappointing Casanova , who believed that he would one day be able to settle down with her . 

Manon died at the age of 36 , questionably from pulmonary hypertension . 

Casanova wrote in his memoirs that he believed his behavior shortened her life .
