The War of the Quadruple Alliance ( 1717 â€“ 1720 ) was a result of the ambitions of Bourbon King Philip V of Spain , his wife , Elisabeth Farnese , and his chief minister Giulio Alberoni to retake territories in Italy lost to the Habsburgs in Vienna , and perhaps even to claim the French throne . 

It saw the defeat of Spain by an alliance of Britain , France , Austria ( then a state of the Holy Roman Empire ) , and the Dutch Republic . 

Savoy later joined the coalition as the fifth ally . 

Although fighting began as early as 1717 , war was not formally declared until December 1718 . 

It was brought to an end by the Treaty of The Hague in 1720 .
