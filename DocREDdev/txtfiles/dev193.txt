Auguste Dreyfus ( 28 June 1827 â€“ 25 May 1897 ) was a French businessman who made his fortune by financing the Peruvian trade in guano . 

Dreyfus joined a small textile trading firm set up by three of his elder brothers and moved to Lima , Peru to act as their local representative . 

He became involved in the guano trade , and in 1869 signed a major contract with the Peruvian government that gave him a monopoly over exports of Peruvian guano to Europe . 

With this he controlled the largest source of Peruvian national income . 

The Peruvian government let Dreyfus act as their agent in managing their existing debt and floating new loans used for railway construction . 

The government ran into increasing financial difficulties . 

These were compounded by a war with Chile between 1879 and 1883 in which they lost their key guano - producing province . 

A lengthy series of lawsuits followed between the creditors whose loans were secured by guano deposits and the governments of Peru and Chile . 

The Dreyfus trading enterprise came to an end . 

He retired to France , where he owned a chateau in the country and a mansion in Paris that he filled with a major collection of art .
