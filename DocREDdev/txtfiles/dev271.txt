L'Oblat ( The Oblate ) is the last novel by the French writer Joris - Karl Huysmans , first published in 1903 . 

It is the final book in Huysmans ' cycle of four novels featuring the character Durtal , a thinly disguised portrait of the author himself . 

Durtal had already appeared in Là - bas , En route and La cathédrale , which traced his ( and the author 's ) conversion to Catholicism . 

In L'Oblat , Durtal becomes an oblate , reflecting Huysmans ' own experiences in the religious community at Ligugé . 

Like many of Huysmans ' other novels , it has little plot . 

The author uses the book to examine the Christian liturgy , express his opinions about the state of Catholicism in contemporary France and explore the question of suffering ( one notable passage describes the Garden of Gethsemane ) .
