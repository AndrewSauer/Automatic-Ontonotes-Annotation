Kerstin Thorborg ( May 19 , 1896 - April 12 , 1970 ) 

Born in Venjan , Sweden , the contralto Kerstin Thorborg was one of the best dramatic Wagnerian singers in the two decades between 1930 and 1950 . 

She made her debut in 1924 singing the difficult role of Ortrud in Lohengrin . 

Eight years later , the famed conductor Bruno Walter engaged her for the Städtische Oper in Berlin and became her mentor . 

Although a contralto , Thorborg 's upper register was so secure that she sang numerous mezzo - soprano roles , including Venus , Kundry , Fricka , Waltraute , and Magdalena . 

She was especially known for her searingly beautiful Brangäne , which was preserved on record . 

She also appears to wonderful advantage in the live recording of Mahler 's Das Lied von der Erde , with Charles Kullmann , under Bruno Walter , at the Vienna Musikverein in 1936 . 

In 1938 , to escape the Nazis , she made her home in the United States , singing various roles at the Met . 

She returned to her native Sweden in 1950 , after her retirement . 

By all accounts , Thorborg was a magnificent actor with great stage presence . 

In addition , she was endowed with a beautifully steady and intense tone .
