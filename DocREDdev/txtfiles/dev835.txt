The Horn Blows at Midnight ( 1945 ) is a comedy fantasy film directed by Raoul Walsh , and starring Jack Benny . 

Its biggest claim to fame , apart from its star , is its failure at the box office . 

In the two decades following its release , Benny often exploited the film 's failure for laughs in his popular radio and television comedy series The Jack Benny Program , making the film a well - known entity to his wide audience , even if they had never seen it . 

The Horn Blows At Midnight would prove to be Benny 's final starring feature , although he would continue as a radio and TV star ( as well as making cameo appearances in films ) for years afterwards . 

The Horn Blows At Midnight had the misfortune to be released only eight days after the death of U.S. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt . 

This may have contributed to its poor reception , although the film 's negative reviews ( often alluded in jokes mentioning the production ) might have also impacted it , as the classic Rodgers and Hammerstein musical Carousel , also dealing with the afterlife , opened on Broadway at roughly the same time and became a hit .
