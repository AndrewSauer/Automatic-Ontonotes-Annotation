Julian Reinard ( born 5 March 1983 ) is a German footballer . 

He first appeared in the German Bundesliga on 21 March 2004 while SC Freiburg 's first and second keepers had been injured . 

A year later media and trainer looked upon him as the future number one of Freiburg , but his disastrous effort during a 0â€“7 defeat against Bayern Munich and the following massive public criticism terminated these ambitions . 

While plying his trade at Hakoah Amidar / Ramat Gan on 23 October 2006 he became the first German footballer ever to play a professional match in Israel . 

Due to problems with his groin he quit Ramat Gan and , after a brief spell at FC Wil , is currently without a team .
