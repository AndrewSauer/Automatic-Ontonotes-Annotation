The Dante Alighieri Society ( Italian : Società Dante Alighieri ) is a society that promotes Italian culture and language around the world . 

Today this society is present in more than 60 countries . 

It was formed in Italy in July 1889 . 

The society was named after Dante Alighieri ( 1265–1321 ) , a pre - Renaissance poet from Florence and the author of The Divine Comedy . 

Dante is considered the father of the Italian language . 

In October 1948 the society was restructured at a meeting in Venice to give total autonomy to all chapters of the Dante Society so that each could conduct its activities independently , under the direction of its own elected officers , in a manner that best suited local needs , preferences , and capacities while adhering to the Society 's basic principles .
