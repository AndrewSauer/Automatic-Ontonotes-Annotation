Tyche (; from , Túkhē , meaning " luck " ; Roman equivalent : Fortuna ) was the presiding tutelary deity who governed the fortune and prosperity of a city , its destiny . 

In Classical Greek mythology , she is the daughter of Aphrodite and Zeus or Hermes . 

In literature , she might be given various genealogies , as a daughter of Hermes and Aphrodite , or considered as one of the Oceanids , daughters of Oceanus , and Tethys , or of Zeus . 

She was connected with Nemesis and Agathos Daimon ( " good spirit " ) . 

The Greek historian Polybius believed that when no cause can be discovered to events such as floods , droughts , frosts , or even in politics , then the cause of these events may be fairly attributed to Tyche .
