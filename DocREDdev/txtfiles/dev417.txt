The Trail Smelter dispute was a trans - boundary pollution case involving the federal governments of both Canada and the United States , which eventually contributed to establishing the Harm principle in the environmental law of transboundary pollution . 

The smelter in Trail , British Columbia was historically operated by the Consolidated Mining and Smelting Company ( COMINCO ) until COMINCO merged with Teck in 2001 , and has processed lead and zinc since 1896 . 

Smoke from the smelter caused damage to forests and crops in the surrounding area and also across the Canada â€“ US border in Washington . 

The smoke from the smelter distressed residents , resulting in complaints to COMINCO and demands for compensation . 

The dispute between the smelter operators and affected landowners could not be resolved , resulting in the case being sent to an arbitration tribunal . 

Negotiation and resulting litigation and arbitration was settled in 1941 .
