The 4th House of Orléans , sometimes called the House of Bourbon - Orléans ( ) to distinguish it , is the fourth holder of a surname previously used by several branches of the Royal House of France , all descended in the legitimate male line from the dynasty 's founder , Hugh Capet . 

The house was founded in 1661 by Prince Philippe , Duke of Anjou , younger son of king Louis XIII and younger brother of king Louis XIV , the " Sun King " . 

From 1709 until the French Revolution , the Orléans dukes were next in the order of succession to the French throne after members of the senior branch of the House of Bourbon , descended from king Louis XIV . 

Although Louis XIV 's direct descendants retained the throne , his brother Philippe 's descendants flourished until the end of the French monarchy . 

They held the Crown from 1830 to 1848 , and they still are pretenders to the French throne .
