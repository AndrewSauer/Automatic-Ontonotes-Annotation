Nexus   Q is a discontinued digital media player developed by Google . 

Unveiled at the Google I / O developers ' conference on June 2012 , the device was expected to be released to the public in the United States shortly thereafter for US$ 300 . 

The Nexus Q was designed to leverage Google 's online media offerings , such as Google Play Music , Google Play Movies & TV , and YouTube , to provide a " shared " experience . 

Users could stream content from the supported services to a connected television , or speakers connected to an integrated amplifier , using their Android device and the services ' respective apps as a remote control for queueing content and controlling playback . 

The Nexus   Q received mixed reviews from critics following its unveiling . 

While its unique spherical design was praised , the Nexus Q was criticized for its lack of functionality in comparison to similar devices such as Apple TV , including a lack of third - party content services , no support for streaming content directly from other devices using the DLNA standard , as well as other software issues that affected the usability of the device . 

The unclear market positioning of the Nexus Q was also criticized , as it carried a significantly higher price than competing media players with wider capabilities ; The New York Times technology columnist David Pogue described the device as being ' wildly overbuilt ' for its limited functions . 

The Nexus   Q was given away at no cost to attendees of Google I / O 27 - 29 June 2012 , but the product 's consumer launch was postponed in July 2012 , purportedly to collect additional feedback . 

Those who had pre - ordered the Nexus   Q following its unveiling received the device at no cost . 

The Nexus   Q was quietly shelved in January 2013 , and support for the device in the Google Play apps was phased out beginning in May 2013 . 

Some of the Nexus   Q 's concepts were repurposed for a more - successful device known as Chromecast , which similarly allows users to wirelessly queue content for playback using functions found in supported apps , but is designed as a smaller HDMI dongle with support for third - party services .
