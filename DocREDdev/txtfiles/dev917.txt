" This Little Girl of Mine " is a rhythm and blues single written and released as a single by Ray Charles in 1955 on the Atlantic label . 

" This Little Girl of Mine " played off " This Little Light of Mine " , much like the previous " I Got a Woman " and the later " Hallelujah I Love Her So " played off other classic gospel hymns . 

And much like those songs , replaced sacred lyrics with secular blues lyrics with doo - wop call and response harmonies . 

The song was the B - side to Charles ' number - one R&B ; single , " A Fool for You " , and was a charted hit on its own , peaking at number nine on the chart . 

The tune was re - made to top 40 pop status in 1958 by The Everly Brothers . 

It should not be confused with the 1981 Gary U.S. Bonds hit " This Little Girl . "
