The Burseraceae are a moderate - sized family of 17 - 19 genera and about 540 species of flowering plants . 

The actual numbers differ according to the time period in which a given source is written describing this family . 

The Burseraceae are also known as the torchwood family , the frankincense and myrrh family , or simply the incense tree family . 

The family includes both trees and shrubs , and is native to tropical regions of Africa , Asia , and the Americas . 

Just as the family size ( in terms of genera and species ) differs according to the time period of the study , so , too , does its placement in the higher ranks . 

Nevertheless , the family is a genetically supported monophyletic group currently and frequently cited within the Sapindales and is recognized as a sister group to the Anacardiaceae . 

The Burseraceae are characterized by the nonallergenic resin they produce in virtually all plant tissue and the distinctive smooth , yet flaking , aromatic bark . 

The origins of the family can be traced to the Paleocene ( about 65 Mya ) when Beiselia mexicana first diverged in Mexico . 

The subsequent divergences in the family lineage and migration of the species in the Eocene ( 53 Mya ) from North America have led to the current distributions of the species that are primarily associated with the tropics . 

Though the family likely originated in North America , the greatest generic diversity presently is in the Southern Hemisphere . 

Tabonuco ( Dacryodes excelsa ) and gumbo limbo ( Bursera simaruba ) represent the economic , ethnobotanical , and ecological significance of the Burseraceae in the Western Hemisphere , while frankincense ( Boswellia sacra ) and myrrh ( Commiphora myrrha ) represent the same in the Eastern Hemisphere .
