The ITS launch vehicle was a 2016 - 2017 design for a privately funded orbital launch vehicle planned to be developed by SpaceX. 

Design work was discontinued in 2017 when development was shifted to a smaller version , now called BFR . 

The initial design objective of the ITS launch vehicle was to launch a variety of SpaceX Interplanetary Transport System missions to Mars and other destinations in the beyond - Earth - orbit portion of the Solar System . 

The first launch was not expected before the 2020s . 

The ITS launch vehicle was to be operated as a somewhat unusual two - stage rocket . 

Its first stage was to have been powered by 42 Raptor rocket engines — designed and manufactured by SpaceX — operating on densified ( chilled near triple point ) methane / oxygen , propellants that have not been widely used as rocket propellants in the past . 

Like the Falcon 9 orbital launch vehicle that preceded it , the ITS launch vehicle 's first stage design was intended to be reusable , following a return to the launch site and vertical landing following each launch . 

When announced , it was also designed to have a new feature for SpaceX launch vehicles : full reusability of even the second - stage and orbital spacecraft as well . 

The large payload capacity of the launch vehicle placed it into the super - heavy lift class , with the ability to place into low Earth orbit in reusable configuration and in expendable mode . 

The second stage of the Earth launch vehicle was planned to have two versions , the Interplanetary spaceship for passengers and cargo and the ITS tanker to deliver propellants to Earth orbit . 

Both were to be powered by six vacuum - optimized Raptor rocket engines with three additional sea - level - nozzle Raptor engines for maneuvering . 

Thus , the element of the launch vehicle that was to provide second - stage acceleration to orbital velocity on all launches from Earth would also be used as an on - orbit spacecraft . 

The Interplanetary spaceship was planned as a very long - duration carrier of both passengers and space cargo to interplanetary destinations , and was to have served as both a descent and ascent vehicle at Mars . 

The high - level specifications for the vehicle were publicly announced in September 2016 , but by July 2017 , SpaceX had stated they would not build the -diameter vehicles as previously planned , but would instead build a " still large " but much smaller launch vehicle first . 

Subsequently , that was revealed to be the BFR in September 2017 , a vehicle intended to cost - effectively replace and supersede all existing SpaceX launch vehicles and passenger / cargo spacecraft .
