Aino is a figure in the Finnish national epic Kalevala . 

It relates that she was the beautiful sister of Joukahainen . 

Her brother , having lost a singing contest to the storied Väinämöinen , promised Aino 's " hands and feet " in marriage if Väinämöinen would save him from drowning in the swamp into which Joukahainen had been thrown . 

Aino 's mother was pleased at the idea of marrying her daughter to such a famous and well born person , but Aino did not want to marry such an old man . 

Rather than submit to this fate , Aino drowned herself ( or ended up as a nix ) . 

However , she returned to taunt the grieving Väinämöinen as a salmon . 

The name Aino , meaning " the only one " , was invented by Elias Lönnrot who composed the Kalevala . 

In the original poems she was mentioned as " the only daughter " ( aino tytti ) .
