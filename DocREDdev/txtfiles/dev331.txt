During the American Civil War , music played a prominent role on both sides of the conflict : Union and Confederate . 

On the American Civil War battlefield , different instruments including bugles , drums , and fifes were played to issue marching orders or sometimes simply to boost the morale of one 's fellow soldiers . 

Singing was also employed as a recreational activity but as a release from the inevitable tensions that come with fighting in a war , particularly a war in which the issue of freedom of a race is to be decided . 

In camp , music was a diversion away from the bloodshed , helping the soldiers deal with homesickness and boredom . 

Soldiers of both sides often engaged in recreation with musical instruments , and when the opposing armies were near each other , sometimes the bands from both sides of the conflict played against each other on the night before a battle . 

Each side had its particular favorite tunes , while some music was enjoyed by Northerners and Southerners alike , as exemplified by United States President Abraham Lincoln 's love of Dixie , the unofficial anthem of the Confederacy . 

To this day , many of the songs are sung when a patriotic piece is required . 

The war 's music also inspired music artists such as Lynyrd Skynyrd and Elvis Presley .
