Watts Station is a train station built in 1904 in Watts , Los Angeles , California . 

It was one of the first buildings in Watts , and for many years , it was a major stop for the Pacific Electric Railway 's " Red Car " service between Los Angeles and Long Beach . 

It was the only structure that remained intact when stores along 103rd Street in Watts were burned in the 1965 Watts Riots . 

Remaining untouched in the middle of the stretch of street that came to be known as " Charcoal Alley " , the station became a symbol of continuity , hope , and renewal for the Watts community . 

It has since been declared a Historic - Cultural Monument and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places .
