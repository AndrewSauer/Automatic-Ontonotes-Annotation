University is the 1995 album by the American alternative rock band Throwing Muses , released on Sire Records and Reprise Records in the USA , and on 4AD elsewhere . 

It features the single " Bright Yellow Gun " , the band 's first national hit . 

The album 's radio exposure led to feature articles in Rolling Stone and other major music magazines . 

The album was recorded in the fall of 1993 , right before lead Muse Kristin Hersh recorded her first solo album , Hips and Makers . 

4AD founder and president Ivo Watts - Russell convinced Hersh to release the solo album first , in early 1994 . 

This led to this album being delayed until 1995 . 

Despite all the positive notices and exposure for the album , sales were disappointingly low , and the band was dropped from Sire 's roster , ending the Muses ' major label years . 

The band has continued sporadically ever since , releasing two more albums on the independent 4AD , one in 1996 and one in 2003 , before releasing 2013 's Purgatory / Paradise on their own label .
