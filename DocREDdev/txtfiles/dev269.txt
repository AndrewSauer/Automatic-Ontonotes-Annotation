In 1931 , Home Minister Adachi Kenzō spoke out strongly in support of the Imperial Japanese Army ’s unauthorized incursions into Manchuria and against the diplomatic policies pursued by Kijūrō Shidehara , and was expelled from the ranks of the Rikken Minseitō . 

Joining together with Nakano Seigō , Akira Kazami , and others , Adachi formed the right - wing political organization Kokumin Dōmei in December 1932 

The Kokumin Dōmei advocated a form of state socialism or corporatism with government control of strategic industries and financial institutions , and the creation of a Japan - Manchukuo economic union . 

The new party consisted mainly of defectors from the Minseitō , and had an original strength of 32 seats in the Diet of Japan . 

In 1934 , it demanded an inquiry into the Teijin Incident in an effort to bring down the cabinet of Prime Minister Saitō Makoto . 

However , in 1935 , many members returned to the Minseitō fold , and in 1936 , Nakano left the party to form the Tōhōkai the following year , and Kazami joining Fumimaro Konoe ’s think tank , the Shōwa Kenkyūkai . 

In the 1937 General Election , the party 's strength fell from 32 seats to 11 seats . 

In June 1940 , The Kokumin Dōmei was merged into the Imperial Rule Assistance Association as part of Hideki Tōjō 's efforts to create a one - party state , and thereafter ceased to exist .
