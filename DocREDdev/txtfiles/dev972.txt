The Georgi Dimitrov Mausoleum ( ) was a ceremonial tomb on Prince Alexander of Battenberg Square in Sofia , Bulgaria , from 1949 to 1999 . 

The white marble mausoleum was built in 1949 to contain the embalmed body of Bulgaria 's first Communist leader , Georgi Dimitrov ( 1882 â€“ 1949 ) , construction beginning immediately after the news of Dimitrov 's death . 

It was completed in just six days , the time it took Dimitrov 's body to be returned to Sofia from the USSR . 

Dimitrov 's body remained in the mausoleum until August 1990 , when Dimitrov 's remains were cremated and the ashes buried in the Sofia 's Central Cemetery . 

The mausoleum itself was destroyed by Prime Minister Ivan Kostov 's UDF government in 1999 after a heated nationwide debate . 

The prime minister and his party claimed that retaining the mausoleum was inappropriate following the fall of Communism in 1989 because it represented Bulgaria 's repressive past . 

Even within the government there was opposition to destroying the building , and an opinion poll revealed that two - thirds of the population opposed the demolition . 

Proposals were made to turn the mausoleum into a museum or art gallery because it contributed to the unique atmosphere of the capital city . 

In August 1999 , the government made four attempts to demolish the building . 

The first three failed because they relied on a single powerful explosion . 

The building did not budge after the first two attempts and tilted only slightly after the third . 

The fourth ( and successful ) attempt was carried out using a series of consecutive , less powerful explosions .
