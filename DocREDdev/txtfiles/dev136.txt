The Exe estuary is an estuary on the south coast of Devon , England . 

The estuary starts just to the south ( ) of the city of Exeter , and extends south for approximately eight miles to meet the English Channel ( ) . 

The estuary is a ria and so is larger than would be the case given the size of the River Exe , the main river feeding into the estuary . 

On the east shore ( from north to south ) are the town of Topsham , the villages of Exton and Lympstone and at the estuary mouth , the seaside resort of Exmouth . 

Opposite Exmouth on the west shore is the village of Dawlish Warren with its sand spit extending across the mouth of the estuary . 

Above this there are fewer settlements on the west shore , with just the villages of Starcross and Cockwood , both adjoining the lower portion of the estuary . 

The River Clyst also feeds into the estuary , just below Topsham . 

The River Kenn feeds into the estuary near Kenton . 

The soil is alluvial , derived from Devonian , Carboniferous and Permian rocks .
