The northern bald ibis , hermit ibis , or waldrapp ( Geronticus eremita ) is a migratory bird found in barren , semi - desert or rocky habitats , often close to running water . 

This glossy black ibis , which , unlike many members of the ibis family , is non - wading , has an unfeathered red face and head , and a long , curved red bill . 

It breeds colonially on coastal or mountain cliff ledges , where it typically lays two to three eggs in a stick nest , and feeds on lizards , insects , and other small animals . 

The northern bald ibis was once widespread across the Middle East , northern Africa , southern and central Europe , with a fossil record dating back at least 1.8 Â  million years . 

It disappeared from Europe over 300 years ago , and is now considered critically endangered . 

There are believed to be about 500 wild birds remaining in southern Morocco , and fewer than 10 in Syria , where it was rediscovered in 2002 . 

To combat this ebb in numbers , recent reintroduction programs have been instituted internationally , with a semi - wild breeding colony in Turkey , as well as sites in Austria , Spain , and northern Morocco . 

The reasons for the species ' long - term decline are unclear , but hunting , loss of foraging habitat , and pesticide poisoning have been implicated in the rapid loss of colonies in recent decades .
