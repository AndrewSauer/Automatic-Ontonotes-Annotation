Aspren or Asprenas ( ) was a 1st - century Christian saint and venerated as the first Bishop of Naples . 

Aspren lived at the end of the 1st century and in the early 2nd century , as confirmed by archaeological studies regarding the early Neapolitan Church as well as the fact that " Aspren " was a common name during the days of the Roman Republic and the early years of the Roman Empire and afterwards fell into disuse . 

The Marble Calendar of Naples ( Calendario Marmoreo di Napoli ) attests to Aspren 's existence and the fact that he lived during the reigns of Trajan and Hadrian ; Aspren 's episcopate is stated as lasting twenty - three years . 

Nothing is known of his life , but an ancient legend holds that Saint Peter , on his way to Rome , stopped at Naples and converted an old woman ( identified as Candida the Elder ) after he cured her of an illness . 

Numerous other converts to Christianity were made during this time in Naples , including Aspren , who was converted either by Peter or Candida herself and who had also been ill . 

The legend holds that Peter consecrated Aspren as bishop of Naples and asked him to construct the oratory of Santa Maria del Principio , which would form the basis for the basilica of Santa Restituta ; San Pietro ad Aram was also said to have been built during this time .
