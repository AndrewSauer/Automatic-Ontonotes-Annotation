Jephté ( Jephtha ) is an opera by the French composer Michel Pignolet de Montéclair . 

It takes the form of a tragédie en musique in a prologue and five acts ( because of its subject matter it was also styled a tragédie biblique ) . 

The libretto , by the Abbé Simon - Joseph Pellegrin , is based on the Biblical story of Jephtha . 

The oratorio was first performed at the Académie royale de musique , Paris on 28 February 1732 . 

It was the first opera in France using a story from the Bible to appear on a public stage . 

For this reason , Cardinal de Noailles banned performances of the work for a time . 

Montéclair made revisions for revivals of the work in March 1732 and April 1737 . 

In 1735 , the soprano who had premiered Iphise , Catherine - Nicole Lemaure , was forced to appear in that year 's revival via threats of imprisonment if she would not do so ; therefore , she intentionally bombed the performance and was booed at by the audience . 

She was detained overnight at For - l'Évêque , a Parisian prison , until she returned the next night to sing the role correctly .
