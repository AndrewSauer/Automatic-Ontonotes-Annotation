Devi - Chandraguptam ( IAST : DevÄ«candraguptam ) or Devi - Chandragupta is an Indian Sanskrit - language political drama authored by Vishakhadatta . 

The complete text of the play is now lost , but its portions survive in form of quotations in the later works . 

The plot also survives in form of a Persian language story , which appears to be a adaptation of the play , and is included in the 11th century text Majmal - ut - Tawarikh . 

In the play , king Ramagupta decides to surrender his queen Dhruvadevi ( " Devi " ) to a Shaka enemy when besieged . 

Ramagupta 's younger brother Chandragupta enters the enemy camp disguised as the queen , and kills the enemy ruler . 

The rest of the story is not clear from the surviving passages , but based on other historical evidence , it appears that in the last part of the play , Chandragupta dethrones Ramagupta and marries Dhruvadevi .
