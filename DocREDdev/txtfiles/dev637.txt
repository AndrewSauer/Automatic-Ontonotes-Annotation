King Louie is a fictional character introduced in Walt Disney 's 1967 animated musical film , The Jungle Book . 

Unlike the majority of the adapted characters in the film , Louie was not featured in Rudyard Kipling 's original works . 

King Louie was portrayed as an orangutan who was the leader of the other jungle primates , and who attempted to gain knowledge of fire from Mowgli , in order to become more human . 

King Louie was voiced by Louis Prima in the original 1967 film . 

Initially , the filmmakers considered Louis Armstrong for the role , but to avoid the likely controversy that would result from casting a black person to voice an ape , they instead chose Prima , a white singer . 

Christopher Walken voiced King Louie in the 2016 live - action / CGI The Jungle Book film .
