The Beijing Shougang Ducks ( simplified Chinese : 北京鸭篮球俱乐部 ) , also known as Beijing Shougang or Beijing Ducks , are a professional basketball team based in Beijing , China , which plays in the North Division of the Chinese Basketball Association . 

The Shougang Corporation is the club 's corporate sponsor while its mascot is a duck . 

The team was formerly known as the Beijing Jinyu Ducks or Beijing Jinyu ( 北京金隅 , běijīng jīnyü ) . 

The name change was due to a change in corporate sponsorship . 

This organization should not be confused with the Beijing Olympians , a different club , which was founded in 1955 . 

For at least part of the 2003–04 CBA season , the Ducks were known as Beijing Wanfeng Aote ( 北京万丰奥特 ) . 

Their naming rights were then assumed by the " Beijing Jinyu Group Co. , Ltd. " , a prominent construction materials conglomerate in China .
