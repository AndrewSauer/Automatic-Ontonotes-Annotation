Christian Hee Hwass ( 1731 – 1803 ) was a Danish malacologist who is remembered for his work in conchology . 

Although born in Denmark , Hwass did most of his important work in France . 

He moved to Paris in 1780 , and later Auteuil ( 1794 ) . 

In France , he collaborated with famous scientists Jean - Baptiste Lamarck ( 1744 – 1829 ) and Heinrich Christian Friedrich Schumacher ( 1757 – 1830 ) , a fellow Dane on a research trip in Paris during the 1780s . 

Hwass is remembered for amassing a large shell collection that included numerous rare specimens . 

Many European scientists used the collection as a reference work for their personal publications . 

Hwass 's best - known written work was the 1792 publication of Encyclopedie Methodique . 

Although his friend , Jean Guillaume Bruguière ( 1750 – 1798 ) , is often credited as author of the encyclopedia , the majority of the work was done by Hwass .
