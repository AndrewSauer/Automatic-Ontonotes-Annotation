Altsys Corporation was a Texas - based software company founded by James R. Von Ehr II . 

It was an early Apple Macintosh developer and publisher . 

Three major products from Altsys for PC / Macintosh and NeXT were : 

Fontographer for Windows and Mac OS - font editor 

Font - O - Matic for Windows - font transformer 

Virtuoso for NeXT / OpenSTEP and Solaris - vector editor ( a version was announced , advertised and demonstrated for Windows NT , but never released ) 

Altsys ' best known product was basically a rebranded Virtuoso licensed to Aldus Corporation under the FreeHand name , was a vector drawing program that competed with Adobe Illustrator . 

It was published for many years , originally only on the Macintosh , then also for Microsoft Windows . 

When Aldus was acquired by Adobe , the licensing agreement that Altsys had with Aldus precluded FreeHand from being part of the deal , so the publishing rights reverted to Altsys . 

Altsys also published Metamorphosis for Macintosh , a font utility . 

Altsys was acquired by Macromedia in January , 1995 . 

Von Ehr became a major Macromedia shareholder and joined the Macromedia board of directors .
