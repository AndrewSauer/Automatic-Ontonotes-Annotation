" The Killers " is a short - story by Charles Bukowski collected in his 1973 collection South of No North , originally published by John Martin 's Black Sparrow Press . 

The story elucidates Bukowski 's publicly acknowledged artistic debt to Ernest Hemingway , the writer who had the most influence on American writers of Bukowksi 's generation . 

Like " The Killers " , Bukowski 's story of the same name has as its thematic trope Murder in a nihilistic universe . 

Unlike Hemingway , the killers actually accomplish their act in the time - frame of the story . 

Bukowski 's authorial point of view in his version of " The Killers " also is influenced by Hemingway , as he it be seen as a logical outgrowth of the attitude expressed by Hemingway 's fictional alter - ego Nick Adams at the end of the 1927 " Killers " : 

Bukowski 's fiction is full of attempts to escape the Los Angeles of his childhood and teen - years , all of which are doomed to failure as his fictional alter - ego , Henry Chinaski , finds the same appalling corruption everywhere he travels . 

In Bukowski 's " The Killers " , there is no escape for the murderers who are the protagonists of the story , mirroring the doomed boxer Ole Andreson in Hemingway 's original .
