Dan Sterling is an American screenwriter and television producer who has worked on many successful television shows , including King of the Hill , Kitchen Confidential , The Daily Show , South Park , The Sarah Silverman Program and The Office . 

Sterling 's recent work , The Interview , became famous after it was seen as an act of war by the supreme leader of the Democratic People 's Republic of Korea , Kim Jong - un . 

The Guardians of the Peace made terrorist threats of " a 9/11 style attack " against cinemas who planned to screen the film , and also threatened the safety of Sony Pictures employees and their families . 

As a result of these threats , Sony Pictures initially cancelled the release of The Interview , though it was later given a limited theatrical release , with broad digital release online through a Sony website , Google Play , Microsoft 's Xbox Video , and YouTube Movies .
