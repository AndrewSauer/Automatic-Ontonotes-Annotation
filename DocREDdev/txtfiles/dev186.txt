The Wagner â€“ Rogers Bill was proposed United States legislation which would have increased the quota of immigrants by bringing a total of 20,000 Jewish children ( there was no sectarian criteria ) under the age of 14 ( 10,000 in 1939 , and another 10,000 in 1940 ) to the United States from Nazi Germany . 

The bill was sponsored by Senator Robert F. Wagner ( D - N.Y. ) and Rep. Edith Rogers ( R - Mass . ) 

in the wake of the 1938 Kristallnacht attacks on Jews in Germany . 

The bill was introduced to Congress on February 9 , 1939 . 

The bill had widespread support among religious and labor groups , but was opposed by nationalist organizations . 

It never came to a vote because it was blocked by Senator Robert Rice Reynolds of North Carolina , who held a powerful position because of his seniority . 

Reynolds was an anti - Semite and Anglophobe who was among those whose support President Roosevelt needed for American rearmament .
