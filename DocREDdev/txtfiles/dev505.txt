Typhoon Vicente , known in the Philippines as Tropical Depression Ferdie , was regarded as the most powerful storm to strike southern China in recent years , as it made landfall as a powerful category 4 equivalent - typhoon . 

Vicente struck Macau and nearly impacted Hong Kong , as well as Guangdong and Guangxi provinces in China . 

Vicente , the eighth named storm and third typhoon in the 2012 Pacific typhoon season , began life as a tropical depression on July 18 , 2012 north east of the Philippines . 

Vicente soon steadily moved into the South China Sea , and began to intensify above warm sea waters , and began explosive intensification early on July 23 , and started to charge toward the Guangdong region prompting the Hong Kong Observatory ( HKO ) to issue the Hurricane Signal , No . 

10 , the first since York in 1999 . 

The Macao Meteorological and Geophysical Bureau also hoisted the Signal No . 

9 for the first time since York and after the transfer of sovereignty over Macau . 

Late on the same day , Vicente made landfall over Taishan in Guangdong , China .
