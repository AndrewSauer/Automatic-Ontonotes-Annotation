The Game is a dice game designed by Reinhold Wittig . 

It was first published in Germany in 1979 , without rules and under the German name Das Spiel . 

It contains a triangular base plate and 281 dice of four different colours , and a rule book that gives rules for some 50 + games . 

Most of the games are centered on building or demolishing pyramids of dice , but there are also racing games and games of skill . 

The game has been originally published by Diego Rodriguez ( Reinhold Wittig ) , GÃ¶ttingen , in 1979 . 

The Game won the 1980 Spiel des Jahres special award for " most beautiful game " . 

In his preface Wittig writes : 

I 've often been asked how you go about it to invent a game . 

I want to add one answer now . 

Is perhaps the best answer possible to show the many different ways of designing a game . 

The answer is also a challenge : Invent rules of your own to my dice pyramid . 

The first edition of the game was a small version of the dice pyramid , without any rules . 

Over time , players contributed their own rules to a collection .
