TY.O is the third studio album by British record producer and recording artist Taio Cruz . 

Taking a more electronic music sound than his previous releases , TY.O was released in December 2011 by Universal Island Records but for reasons unknown to Cruz , its British and American release were held off . 

Instead , a year after its original release , an extended play ( EP ) version of the album titled The Fast Hits was released in the UK on 16 December 2012 . 

TY.O features a range of top - twenty and top - thirty singles including " Hangover " ( featuring Flo Rida ) , " Troublemaker " , " There She Goes " ( sometimes featuring Pitbull ) , the limited release " World in Our Hands " and " Fast Car " which features on the Special Edition and Fast Hits versions of the album . 

The album itself reached top - twenty in Switzerland and top - thirty in Germany , considerably less successful than Cruz 's previous albums .
