San Pablito is a small town located on the side of the Guajalote Mountain in the Sierra Norte de Puebla mountain region in central east Mexico . 

It belongs to the Pahuatl√°n municipality of the state of Puebla . 

Culturally it is dominated by the Otomi although it is part of the La Huasteca region . 

San Pablito is best known for the commercial production of a bark paper called amate as a handcraft . 

This paper is mostly sold to Nahua painters in Guerrero , but it is also sold nationally and internationally on its own . 

The paper is made much the way it was before the arrival of the Spanish . 

Originally , it was made only by the area 's shamans for ritual purpose but today commercial production is mostly done by the town 's women and children as many men have left to work in the United States .
