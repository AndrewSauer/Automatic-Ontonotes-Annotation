Paul Ralph Ehrlich ( born May 29 , 1932 ) is an American biologist , best known for his warnings about the consequences of population growth and limited resources . 

He is the Bing Professor of Population Studies of the Department of Biology of Stanford University and president of Stanford 's Center for Conservation Biology . 

Ehrlich became well known for his controversial 1968 book The Population Bomb , which asserted that the world 's human population would soon increase to the point where mass starvation ensued . 

Among the solutions he suggested in that book was population control , to be used in his opinion if voluntary methods were to fail . 

Ehrlich has been criticized for his opinions ; for example , Ronald Bailey termed Ehrlich an " irrepressible doomster " . 

However , Carl Haub observed that Ehrlich 's warnings had encouraged governments to change their policies to avert disaster . 

Ehrlich has acknowledged that some of what he predicted has not occurred , but maintains that his predictions about disease and climate change were essentially correct , and that human overpopulation is a major problem .
