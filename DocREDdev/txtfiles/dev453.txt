According to the Bible , Medan ( " contention ; to twist , conflict " ) ; also spelt Madan was the third son of Abraham , the patriarch of the Israelites , and Keturah whom he we d after the death of Sarah . 

Medan had five brothers , Zimran , Jokshan , Midian , Ishbak , and Shuah . 

Josephus tells us that " Abraham contrived to settle them in colonies ; and they took possession of Troglodytis and the country of Arabia Felix ( Arabia the Happy ) , as far as it reaches to the Red Sea . " 

Abraham , in all probability , tried to keep them apart from Isaac to avoid conflict while fulfilling God 's commission to spread out and inhabit the globe . 

Little else is known about him . 

There is no known connection to the Madan people of Iran and Iraq .
