The law of the Cayman Islands is a combination of common law and statute , and is based heavily upon English law . 

Law in the Cayman Islands tends to be a combination of the very old and the very new . 

As a leading offshore financial centre , the Cayman Islands has extremely modern statutes dealing with company law , insolvency , banking law , trust law , insurance and other related matters . 

However , in other areas of law , such as family law , the laws of the Cayman Islands are based upon old English statutes which can cause some difficulty in modern times . 

Other areas of law , such as international law , are essentially regulated externally through the Foreign and Commonwealth Office in London by Order in Council . 

A large body of the laws of the Cayman Islands consists of the common law , which continually updates itself through judicial precedent in the Territory and in other common law countries . 

The Cayman Islands is a dependent territory of the United Kingdom . 

Although the local legislature and courts are independent from the United Kingdom , the British Government deals with all international relations on behalf of the Territory . 

The Cayman Islands does not have a separate vote at the United Nations .
