The Storming of the Winter Palace was a 1920 mass spectacle , based on historical events that took place in Petrograd during the 1917 October Revolution . 

Taking place on the third anniversary of the revolution , it was directed by Nikolai Evreinov and was subtitled a " mass action . " 

The sets were designed by Yuri Annenkov . 

The spectacle was staged outside the former Tsarist Winter Palace where the Provisional Government was meeting at the time of the Bolshevik revolution . 

Its performers included 125 ballet dancers , 100 circus people , 1,750 supernumeraries and students , 200 women , 260 secondary actors , and 150 assistants . 

There were also tanks and armoured cars involved . 

The mass spectacle form took the pre - revolutionary Symbolist utopias of " ritual theatre " ( whose formulation was largely a response to the abortive 1905 revolution ) , and recast their " people " as the proletariat . 

Performed on 7 November before 100,000 spectators , the action begins with the February Revolution , follows the gradual organization of the workers ( on a red stage to the left , with Kerensky and the Provisional Government on a white stage to the right ) , until they are illuminated fully by searchlights , and crying " Lenin , Lenin " charge over the arch which joins the two stages to do battle with the " Whites . " 

Kerensky leaps to a car for an escape , and is pursued along a path between the two large groups of spectators by trucks full of the Red Guard waving bayonets , to the Palace . 

Silhouettes struggle in the windows of the Palace , until the Red Army is finally successful , and red lights flash out . 

A cannon fired from the cruiser Aurora and fireworks herald the victory of the October Revolution .
