Bicycles & Tricycles is the sixth studio album from the Orb . 

It brought together The Orb 's style of the early 1990s with current electronic music to mixed reactions . 

The Daily Telegraph praised Bicycles & Tricycles as being " inclusive , exploratory , and an enjoyable journey " ; however , many other publications dismissed it as " stoner dub " and largely irrelevant to current electronic music culture . 

In addition to Paterson , Roome , Phillips , and Fehlmann , The Corporal contributed with vocoder affected singing and MC Soom - T provided lyrics and rapped . 

Orb co - founder Jimmy Cauty , too , made a guest appearance as co - writer on Bicycles & Tricycles ' " From a Distance " . 

After departing from Island Records , The Orb released Bicycles & Tricycles in 2004 on Cooking Vinyl in the United Kingdom and Sanctuary Records in the United States . 

To promote the album , The Orb began a UK tour with dub reggae artist Mad Professor , who had remixed The Orb in the past . 

Though The Orb still pulled in large crowds , The Guardian described one London performance as " joyless " and stated that " few of the new tracks ... really go anywhere " . 

They also noted that Paterson seemed to be far more comfortable and happier to play material from Bicycles & Tricycles rather than older tracks . 

Paterson 's biggest influences for the album were drum and bass and trip hop music .
