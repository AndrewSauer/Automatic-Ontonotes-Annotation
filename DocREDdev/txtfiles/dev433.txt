Rachel Perry ( born 1962 , formerly Rachel Perry Welty ) is an American artist . 

She is known for conceptual works using drawing , photography , video , collage , sculpture and performance , which address “ the fleeting nature of experience , the elusiveness of desire , and the persistence of objects in a throwaway culture . ” Art critic Jerry Saltz has written that her work " not only grappl[es ] with consumerism but [ she is ] just about swallowed whole by it . ” Her work also considers themes of gender identity , narcissism , privacy and information overload . 

She has exhibited widely throughout the United States and internationally , including a solo exhibition at Yancey Richardson Gallery in 2015 , about which art critic Roberta Smith wrote , “ … obsessive delights await in this strange and beautiful show … ” 

She lives and works in Gloucester , Massachusetts and Brooklyn , New York .
