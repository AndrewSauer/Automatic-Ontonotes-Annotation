Scotch and Soda is a magic effect involving a copper coin and a silver coin which appear to transpose in the spectator 's hands . 

The effect relies on simple gimmick and tricks can be performed with it that are self - working , requiring almost no skill . 

The trick is named after the cocktail Scotch and soda ; the copper coin represents the " Scotch " and the silver coin represents the " soda " . 

The effect is usually performed as follows : The magician displays two coins of almost equal size , one copper and one silver . 

The silver coin is most often a U.S. half dollar and the copper coin is usually either an English penny or a Mexican centavo . 

The magician stacks the coins and places them into the spectator 's hand . 

He then asks her to place her hands behind her back and put one coin in each hand , remarking that the silver coin is slightly larger than the copper coin , making them easy to tell apart . 

The magician asks to see the silver coin which the spectator produces . 

When the spectator opens her other hand , the copper coin has become a quarter . 

The copper coin can then be made to appear wherever the magician desires , such as in the spectator 's pocket or under an object across the room . 

Scotch and Soda is a popular trick that can be purchased at magic stores . 

A number of books exclusively on the subject describe different effects that can be achieved with the Scotch and Soda gimmick . 

Gin and tonic is a version of the trick using a dime and a penny . 

Another more recent version is Captain & Coke 2.0 as released by the Blue Crown , it uses a US quarter and a US penny . 

The modern version that uses a 20 Centavo and a Kennedy half is often attributed to Richard Himber . 

In the early 1900s , America 's oldest magic company , Martinka made a version that utilized a Barber half dollar and a large cent .
