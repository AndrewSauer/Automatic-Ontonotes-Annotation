America 's Sweetheart is the debut studio album by American alternative rock musician Courtney Love , released worldwide on February 10 , 2004 by Virgin Records . 

Her first official release after her former band Hole 's break - up , the album 's sound diverged significantly in musical and lyrical content to Hole 's three previous studio albums : Pretty on the Inside ( 1991 ) , Live Through This ( 1994 ) and Celebrity Skin ( 1998 ) . 

The recording process of the album began in summer 2001 in Los Angeles , California , however , was affected drastically by a number of personal and legal issues by Love ; including her drug problems , the disbandment of Hole , the controversy surrounding Nirvana 's upcoming box set , and legal problems with various record labels . 

In spring 2003 , Love traveled to southern France to re - record the album , however , according to Love , she " just wanted to be in a château for six months and do drugs . " 

The album had three main producers , one of whom , James Barber , was Love 's partner at the time . 

Following recording , America 's Sweetheart was further delayed due to Virgin 's excessive input on the album 's mastering , art work and design , and track listing . 

Upon its release , it received little promotion , with the main source of media exposure being a music video for the album 's first single , " Mono , " and Love 's highly publicised drug issues . 

America 's Sweetheart received mixed reviews and was a commercial failure , selling little over 200,000 copies in the United States , and with Love further citing the album as " a mistake . " 

In more recent years , both Love and producer Linda Perry have referred to the album as " le disaster " and " ruined because [ Love ] was coked out , " respectively . 

The album featured drumming from former Hole drummer Patty Schemel , as well as guest instrumentation and vocals from Emilie Autumn .
