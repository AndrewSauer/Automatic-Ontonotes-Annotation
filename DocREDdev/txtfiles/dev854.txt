This is a list of islands in Western Australia . 

It includes all coastal and inland islands , cays , isles and islets . 

It also includes named island groups , archipelagos and island clumps . 

This list is complete with respect to the 1996 Gazetteer of Australia . 

Dubious names have been checked against the online 2004 data , and in all cases confirmed correct . 

However , if any islands have been gazetted or deleted since 1996 , this list does not reflect these changes . 

Strictly speaking , Australian place names are gazetted in capital letters only ; the names in this list have been converted to mixed case in accordance with normal capitalisation conventions . 

Locations are as gazetted ; obviously some islands may extend over large areas .
