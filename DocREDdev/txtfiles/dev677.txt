Robert William Taylor ( February 10 , 1932   – April 13 , 2017 ) , known as Bob Taylor , was an American Internet pioneer , who led teams that made major contributions to the personal computer , and other related technologies . 

He was director of ARPA 's Information Processing Techniques Office from 1965 through 1969 , founder and later manager of Xerox PARC 's Computer Science Laboratory from 1970 through 1983 , and founder and manager of Digital Equipment Corporation 's Systems Research Center until 1996 . 

Uniquely , Taylor had no formal academic training or research experience in computer science ; Severo Ornstein likened Taylor to a " concert pianist without fingers , " a perception reaffirmed by historian Leslie Berlin : " Taylor could hear a faint melody in the distance , but he could not play it himself . 

He knew whether to move up or down the scale to approximate the sound , he could recognize when a note was wrong , but he needed someone else to make the music . " 

His awards include the National Medal of Technology and Innovation and the Draper Prize . 

Taylor was known for his high - level vision : " The Internet is not about technology ; it 's about communication . 

The Internet connects people who have shared interests , ideas and needs , regardless of geography . "
