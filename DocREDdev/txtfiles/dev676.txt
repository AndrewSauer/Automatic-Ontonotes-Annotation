The SS Keno is a preserved historic sternwheel paddle steamer and National Historic Site of Canada . 

The SS Keno is berthed in a dry dock on the waterfront of the Yukon River in Dawson City , Yukon , Canada . 

The vessel was constructed in 1922 , in Whitehorse , by the British Yukon Navigation Company , a subsidiary of the White Pass and Yukon Route railway company . 

For most of its career it transported silver , zinc and lead ore down the Stewart River from mines in the Mayo district to the confluence of the Yukon and Stewart rivers at Stewart City . 

It was retired from commercial service in 1951 due to the extension and improvement of the Klondike Highway in the years after World War II . 

Following its withdrawal from service the SS Keno was laid up at the BYN Co. shipyard in Whitehorse , before being selected for preservation and donated by the company to the Canadian Government in 1959 . 

On 25 August 1960 the Keno left Whitehorse to sail downstream to Dawson City . 

In doing so she became the last of the Yukon 's sternwheeler steamers to navigate the Yukon River under her own power . 

Three days later she arrived in Dawson and was subsequently installed as a tourist attraction and a permanent memorial to the approximately 250 sternwheelers that provided a vital transport service on the Yukon River and its tributaries during the latter half of the 19th and first half of the 20th centuries .
