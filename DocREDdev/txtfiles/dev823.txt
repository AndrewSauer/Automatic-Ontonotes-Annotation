Major League Baseball ( MLB ) is the highest level of play in North American professional baseball , and is the organization that operates the National League and the American League . 

In 2000 , the two leagues were officially disbanded as separate legal entities , and all of their rights and functions were consolidated in the commissioner 's office . 

Since that time , MLB has operated as a single league , and constitutes one of the major professional sports leagues of the United States . 

It is composed of 30 teams . 

The First - Year Player Draft , also known as the Rule 4 Draft , is MLB primary mechanism for assigning amateur baseball players from high schools , colleges , and other amateur baseball clubs to its teams . 

The first draft took place in 1965 ; it was introduced to prevent richer teams from negotiating wealthier contracts with top - level prospects and therefore , monopolizing the player market . 

Originally , three drafts were held each year . 

The first draft took place in June and involved high - school graduates and college seniors who had just finished their seasons . 

The second draft took place in January for high school and college players who had graduated in December . 

The third draft took place in August and was for players who participated in American amateur summer leagues . 

The August draft was eliminated after two years , and the January draft lasted until 1986 . 

The draft order is determined based on the previous season 's standings , with the team possessing the worst record receiving the first pick . 

In addition , teams that lost free agents in the previous off - season may be awarded " compensatory " picks .
