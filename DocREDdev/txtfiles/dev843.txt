The Association of Australian Artistes was established in London in 1975 by Australian expatriate James Hunt . 

It was based at Australia House and its aims and objectives were to present new Australian plays around London 's Fringe featuring professional Australian actors then living in London . 

The inaugural Production Coordinator was Barbara Angell and a fund - raising concert was held in the Australia House basement on Sunday , 25 January 1976 , coinciding with the Australia Day Weekend . 

Monies raised supported the group during its lifetime . 

Members included Ken Shorter , Darlene Johnson , Bob Hornery , Mark McManus . 

Playwrights who were premiered in London included Steve J. Spears . 

The Association continued for about 2 years , presenting at such as The Arts Theatre , The Gate and various pub rooms until security measures during the IRA bombing campaign inhibited audience attendances .
