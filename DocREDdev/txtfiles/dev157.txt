Guido Bonatti ( died between 1296 and 1300 ) was an Italian mathematician , astronomer and astrologer , who was the most celebrated astrologer of the 13th century . 

Bonatti was advisor of Frederick II , Holy Roman Emperor , Ezzelino da Romano III , Guido Novello da Polenta and Guido I da Montefeltro . 

He also served the communal governments of Florence , Siena and Forl√¨ . 

His employers were all Ghibellines ( supporters of the Holy Roman Emperor ) , who were in conflict with the Guelphs ( supporters of the Pope ) , and all were excommunicated at some time or another . 

Bonatti 's astrological reputation was also criticised in Dante 's Divine Comedy , where he is depicted as residing in hell as punishment for his astrology .

This remained a classic astrology textbook for two centuries .
