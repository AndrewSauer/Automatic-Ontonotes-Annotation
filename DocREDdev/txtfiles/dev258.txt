The Frente de Libertação do Arquipélago da Madeira ( ) , or FLAMA ( which could be read as an archaic Portuguese word for " flame " , flama ) , was a right - wing terrorist paramilitary organisation from Madeira , whose main goal was to achieve Madeira 's independence from mainland Portugal . 

FLAMA carried out more than 70 armed and bomb attacks between 1974 - 1976 , during the revolutionary period that followed the Portuguese Carnation Revolution ( April 25 , 1974 ) . 

The Carnation Revolution effectively changed the Portuguese regime from an authoritarian dictatorship ( the Estado Novo ) to a democracy ( the Third Republic ) , but only after two years of a transitional period known as PREC ( Processo Revolucionário Em Curso , Portuguese for Ongoing Revolutionary Process ) , characterized by social turmoil and power dispute between left and right wing political forces . 

During this period the new government withdrew from Angola and Mozambique , the last Portuguese colonies on mainland Africa . 

Some in Madeira thought that their area should be the next to separate . 

FLAMA 's demands were more a right - wing political reaction by some of the regional elites to the left - wing nature of the Revolution and its main actors , than a truly ethnic or nationalist separatist goal . 

After the normalization of the Portuguese political system , early in 1976 , and the constitutional grant of autonomy to the Portuguese North Atlantic archipelagos of Madeira and Azores ( where a similar organization existed , the Frente de Libertação dos Açores ) , the organization vanished . 

Allegedly one of FLAMA 's most important activists was the controversial Alberto João Jardim , the former President of the regional government of Madeira , co - founder of the Madeiran branch of the popular centre - right - wing Portuguese party PSD and former Vice - president of the European People 's Party .
