The Admission to the Union Clause of the United States Constitution , oftentimes called the New States Clause , and found at Article IV , Section 3 , , authorizes the Congress to admit new states into the United States beyond the thirteen already in existence at the time the Constitution went into effect . 

The Constitution went into effect on June 21 , 1788 , after ratification by 9 of the 13 states , and the federal government began operations under it on March 4 , 1789 . 

Since then , 37 additional states have been admitted into the Union . 

Each new state has been admitted on an equal footing with those already in existence . 

Of the 37 states admitted to the Union by Congress , all but six have been established within an existing U.S. organized incorporated territory . 

A state so created might encompass all or a portion of a territory . 

When the people of a territory or a region thereof would make their desire for statehood known to the federal government , in most cases Congress passed an enabling act authorizing the people of that territory or region to frame a proposed state constitution as a step toward admission to the Union . 

Although the use of an enabling act was a common historic practice , a number of states were admitted to the Union without one . 

In many instances , an enabling act would detail the mechanism by which the territory would be admitted as a state following ratification of their constitution and election of state officers . 

Although the use of such an act is a traditional historic practice , a number of territories have drafted constitutions for submission to Congress absent an enabling act and were subsequently admitted . 

The broad outline for this process was established by the Land Ordinance of 1784 and the 1787 Northwest Ordinance , both of which predate the present U.S. Constitution . 

The Admission to the Union Clause also forbids the creation of new states from parts of existing states without the consent of both the affected states and Congress . 

The primary intent of this caveat was to give Eastern states that still had western land claims ( there were four at that time ) a veto over whether their western counties could become states . 

This clause has served the same function since , each time a proposal to partition an existing state or states has arisen .
