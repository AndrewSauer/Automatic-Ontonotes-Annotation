Load is the sixth studio album by the American heavy metal band Metallica , released on June 4 , 1996 by Elektra Records in the United States and by Vertigo Records internationally . 

The album showed more of a hard rock side of Metallica than the band 's typical thrash metal style , which alienated much of the band 's fanbase . 

It also featured influences from genres such as Southern rock , blues rock , country rock and alternative rock . 

Drummer Lars Ulrich said about Load more exploratory nature , " This album and what we 're doing with it – that , to me , is what Metallica are all about : exploring different things . 

The minute you stop exploring , then just sit down and fucking die " . 

At 79 minutes , it is Metallica 's longest studio album . 

Load debuted and spent four consecutive weeks at number one on the US Billboard 200 chart . 

Load sold 680,000 units in its first week , making it the biggest opening week for Metallica as well as the biggest debut of 1996 . 

It was certified 5× platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America ( RIAA ) for shipping five million copies in the United States . 

Four singles—"Until It Sleeps " , " Hero of the Day " , " Mama Said " , and " King Nothing "— were released as part of the marketing campaign for the album .
