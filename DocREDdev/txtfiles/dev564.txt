The Drake Landing Solar Community ( DLSC ) is a planned community in Okotoks , Alberta , Canada , equipped with a central solar heating system and other energy efficient technology . 

This heating system is the first of its kind in North America , although much larger systems have been built in northern Europe . 

The 52 homes in the community are heated with a solar district heating system that is charged with heat originating from solar collectors on the garage roofs and is enabled for year - round heating by underground seasonal thermal energy storage ( STES ) . 

The system was designed to model a way of addressing global warming and the burning of fossil fuels . 

The solar energy is captured by 800 solar thermal collectors located on the roofs of all 52 houses ' garages . 

It is billed as the first solar powered subdivision in North America , although its electricity and transportation needs are provided by conventional sources . 

In 2012 the installation achieved a world record solar fraction of 97 % ; that is , providing that amount of the community 's heating requirements with solar energy over a one - year time span .
