Mikheil Javakhishvili (; birth surname : Adamashvili ადამაშვილი ) ( 8 November 1880 – 30 September 1937 ) was a Georgian novelist who is regarded as one of the top twentieth - century Georgian writers . 

His first story appeared in 1903 , but then the writer lapsed into a long pause before returning to writing in the early 1920s . 

His recalcitrance to the Soviet ideological pressure cost him life : he was executed during the Great Purge and his writings were banned for nearly twenty years . 

In the words of the modern British scholar of Russian and Georgian literature , Donald Rayfield , " his vivid story - telling , straight in medias res , his buoyant humour , subtle irony , and moral courage merit comparison with those of Stendhal , Guy de Maupassant , and Émile Zola . 

In modern Georgian prose only Konstantine Gamsakhurdia could aspire to the same international level . "
