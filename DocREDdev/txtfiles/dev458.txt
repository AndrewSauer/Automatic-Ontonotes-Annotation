Dom Afonso ( 23 February 1845   – 11 June 1847 ) was the Prince Imperial and heir apparent to the throne of the Empire of Brazil . 

Born in Rio de Janeiro , he was the eldest child of Emperor Dom Pedro   II and Dona Teresa Cristina of the Two Sicilies , and thus a member of the Brazilian branch of the House of Braganza . 

Afonso died from epilepsy at the age of two , devastating the emperor . 

The following year , Pedro and Teresa Cristina had another son , Pedro Afonso , but he too died in infancy . 

After the loss of his second son , doubts grew in Pedro   II 's mind that the imperial system could be viable . 

He still had an heir in his daughter Isabel , but he was unconvinced that a female would prove to be a suitable successor . 

He showed less concern about the effects his policies had on the monarchy , provided his daughter Isabel with no training for her role as potential empress , and failed to cultivate her acceptance within the country 's political class . 

Pedro   II 's lack of interest in protecting the imperial system ultimately led to its downfall .
