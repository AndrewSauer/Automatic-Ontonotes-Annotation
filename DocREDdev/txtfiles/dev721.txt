The War between Armenia and Iberia ( AD 51 ) is known chiefly through its description in Tacitus ' Annals . 

The war took place as a delicate balance of power between the Roman and Parthian empires was in place in the Caucasus . 

Rome was then ruled by Claudius , Parthia by Vologases I. 

Two Iberian brothers then ruled the Caucasian kingdoms , Pharasmanes I in Iberia , Mithridates in Armenia . 

They were both dependent on Roman support , which had installed Mithridates on the Armenian throne in 35 AD . 

However , 15 years later , trust between the brothers had deteriorated , which Tacitus blames on the intrigues of Pharasmanes ' son Rhadamistus . 

Fearing usurpation by Rhadamistus , his father convinced him to make war upon his uncle and claim the Armenian throne for himself . 

The Iberians invaded with a large army and surrounded Mithridates at the fortress of Gorneas ( Garni ) , which was garrisoned by the Romans under the command of Caelius Pollio , a prefect , and Casperius , a centurion . 

Rhadamistus was unable to take the fortress by assault or by siege . 

Pollio , swayed by bribery from Rhadamistus , betrayed Mithridates and induced the Roman soldiers to threaten the capitulation of the garrison . 

Under this threat , Mithridates left the fortress in order to make peace with Rhadamistus . 

Rhadamistus then executed Mithridates and his sons , despite a promise of non - violence , and became King of Armenia . 

Of this usurpation , Tacitus wrote " Rhadamistus might retain his ill - gotten gains , as long as he was hated and infamous ; for this was more to Rome 's interest than for him to have succeeded with glory " . 

However , faced with this upset of the regional balance and fearing that Armenia and Iberia would unite as a single powerful kingdom in the hands of Rhadamistus , Tiridates entered Armenia with Parthian support in 53 AD . 

After 2 years of war , the Armenian nobility revolted and replaced Rhadamistus with the Arsacid prince Tiridates . 

This was unacceptable to Rome , and started the Roman – Parthian War of 58–63 .
