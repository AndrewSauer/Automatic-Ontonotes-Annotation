The " March of the Volunteers " is the national anthem of the People 's Republic of China , including its special administrative regions of Hong Kong and Macau . 

Unlike most previous Chinese state anthems , it is written entirely in the vernacular , rather than in Classical Chinese . 

Its lyrics were composed as a dramatic poem by the poet and playwright , the Japan - educated Tian Han in 1934 and set to music by Nie Er from Yunnan Province the next year for the film Children of Troubled Times . 

It was adopted as the PRC 's provisional anthem in 1949 in place of the " Three Principles of the People " of the Republic of China and the Communist " Internationale " . 

When Tian Han was imprisoned during the Cultural Revolution in the 1960s , the march was briefly and unofficially replaced by " The East Is Red " , then played without words , then played with altered words . 

Restored to its original version , the " March of the Volunteers " was raised to official status in 1982 , adopted by Hong Kong and Macau upon their restorations to China in 1997 and 1999 , respectively , and included in the Chinese Constitution 's Article 136 in 2004 .
