The Hub is an American " computer network music " ensemble formed in 1986 consisting of John Bischoff , Tim Perkis , Chris Brown , Scot Gresham - Lancaster , Mark Trayle and Phil Stone . 

" The Hub was the first live computer music band whose members were all composers , as well as designers and builders of their own hardware and software . " 

The Hub grew from the League of Automatic Music Composers : John Bischoff , Tim Perkis , Jim Horton , and Rich Gold . 

Perkis and Bischoff modified their equipment for a performance at The Network Muse Festival in 1986 at The LAB in San Francisco . 

Instead of creating an ad - hoc wired connection of computer interaction , they decided to use a hub - a general purpose connection for network data . 

This was less failure - prone and enabled greater collaborations . 

The Hub was the first band to do a telematic performance in 1987 at the Clocktower in New York . 

Since this work represents some of the earliest work in the context of the new live music practice of Networked music performance , they have been cited as the archetypal network ensemble in computer music . 

The Hub 's best - known piece , Stuck Note by Scot Gresham - Lancaster has been covered by a number of network music bands , including MiLO- the Milwaukee Laptop Orchestra 

and BiLE- the Birmingham Laptop Ensemble . 

They have collaborated with Rova Saxophone Quartet , Nick Collins , Phill Niblock , and Alvin Curran . 

They currently perform around the world after a multi - year hiatus , ending in 2004 .
