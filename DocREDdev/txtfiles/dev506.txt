In gridiron football , a triple - threat man is a player who excels at all three of the skills of running , passing , and kicking . 

In modern usage , such a player would be referred to as a utility player . 

Triple - threat men were the norm in the early days of football , as substitution rules were stringent . 

Thus , in addition to the need for passing , running , and kicking skills , they were also required to play defense . 

As injury awareness grew and substitution rules loosened , teams shifted to kicking specialists , which made the triple - threat man obsolete . 

One of the last triple - threat men in professional football was George Blanda , a quarterback and kicker who last played for the Oakland Raiders of the National Football League in 1975 . 

Danny White , a quarterback and punter , retired in 1989 . 

Since then , non - specialists have placekicked only extremely infrequently in the NFL . 

One instance occurred when Doug Flutie — also adept at both running and passing as a " scrambling " quarterback — drop kicked an extra point in 2006 during the last play of his career . 

Danny White of the Dallas Cowboys was the last non - specialist to kick on a regular basis , as he served as the team 's starting quarterback and punter from 1980 until 1984 , after several years as backup to Roger Staubach . 

There are , however , still dual - threat quarterbacks and wildcat halfbacks , who can both run and pass . 

A quarterback who played wide receiver in high school or college may sparingly catch passes or be converted into a wide receiver who occasionally passes . 

For over forty years the NFL single - season scoring record was held by a triple - threat man , Green Bay Packers Hall of Famer Paul Hornung . 

Hornung set a record of 176 points in 1960 by scoring fifteen touchdowns , kicking forty - one extra points , and also kicking fifteen field goals .
