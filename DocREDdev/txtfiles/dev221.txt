The policy of Russification of Finland ( Finnish : sortokaudet / sortovuodet - times / years of oppression ) was a governmental policy of the Russian Empire aimed at limiting the special status of the Grand Duchy of Finland and possibly the termination of its political autonomy and cultural uniqueness in 1899 – 1905 and in 1908 – 1917 . 

It was a part of a larger policy of Russification pursued by late 19th – early 20th century Russian governments which tried to abolish cultural and administrative autonomy of non - Russian minorities within the empire . 

The two Russification campaigns evoked widespread Finnish resistance , starting with petitions and escalating to strikes , passive resistance ( including draft resistance ) and eventually active resistance . 

Finnish opposition to Russification was one of the main factors that ultimately led to Finland 's declaration of independence in 1917 .
