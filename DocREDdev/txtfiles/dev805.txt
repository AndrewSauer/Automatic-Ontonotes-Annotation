Operator Toll Dialing was a project and method used by the Bell System in the USA and Canada to automate the switching and billing of long distance calls in the public switched telephone network ( PSTN ) . 

The program was initiated by 1945 , at which time ca . 

5 % of the 2.7 million toll board calls per day were handled by this method . 

Operator Toll Dialing eliminated the need for intermediate and inward operators to complete toll calls to distant central offices . 

Initially this system involved step - by - step routings to set up each circuit , but later was improved by the development of area codes with machine translation which helped to standardize dialing across the network . 

The system was implemented in the USA beginning in 1946 . 

In 1947 , the North American Numbering Plan for area codes was set up . 

Operator Toll DIaling was gradually superseded by Direct Distance Dialing ( DDD ) , in which the customer dialed the area code as well as the number . 

Beginning in 1951 on a limited basis , it was not fully implemented until the 1970s . 

Telephone administrations in other countries implemented similar programs , such as in the United Kingdom , which led to Subscriber Trunk Dialling ( STD ) .
