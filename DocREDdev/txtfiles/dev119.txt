The Toyota Avalon is a full - size car produced by Toyota in the United States , and is Toyota 's largest front - wheel - drive sedan in the United States , Canada , Puerto Rico , and the Middle East . 

It was also produced in Australia from April 2000 until June 2005 , when it was replaced in November 2006 by the Toyota Aurion . 

The first production Avalon rolled off the TMMK assembly line in Georgetown , Kentucky , in September 1994 . 

A second - generation model was released in the United States and Japan in 1999 . 

Toyota marketed the Avalon as a replacement for the Toyota Cressida , a model discontinued for the American market in 1992 . 

While the Cressida was an upper - level midsize rear - wheel - drive car with a straight - six engine , the Avalon is front - wheel - drive , powered by a V6 engine . 

In recent years , there has been considerable overlapping with its platform mates , the Toyota Camry V6 and the Lexus ES , although the third - generation Avalon was distinguished by offering extra legroom . 

For its fourth generation , the Avalon was introduced on a platform that is shared with the Lexus ES . 

As of 2013 , the Toyota Avalon is available in the United States , Canada , Puerto Rico , South Korea , and the Middle East . 

Avalon is a legendary island featured in the Arthurian legend , fitting it in with Toyota 's tradition of naming their sedans the word for " crown " in various languages ( Crown , Corona , Camry , Corolla ) , types of crowns ( Tiara ) , or other things associated with royalty ( Scepter ) .
