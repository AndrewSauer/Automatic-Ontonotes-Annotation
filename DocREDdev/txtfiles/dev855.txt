Ripton is a fictitious town in Massachusetts , United States . 

Hugh Davis , brother of Hester A. Davis and a professor at the University of Massachusetts Amherst , sought to demonstrate and protest the ignorance of the state bureaucracy in Boston of the rural portions of the commonwealth . 

To do so , he invented the town of Ripton . 

He then proceeded to apply for various grants and other official assistance , and the town was allotted funds in the state budget . 

Several checks were issued , and deposited in an escrow account , before the hoax was uncovered . 

The funds were returned and the matter dropped . 

In 1985 , Representatives of the town of Ripton contacted the US Air Force and invited them to situate antennas for a post - nuclear war communication system in their town . 

Robbins Phillips , chairman of the Board of Selectmen of Ripton , stated that the antennas would make good nesting places for eagles . 

As a protest of the issue today , some signposts in the western portion of Massachusetts still contain " directions " to Ripton . 

Lawmakers in western Massachusetts continued to humorously reference the incident in proposed state budgets .
