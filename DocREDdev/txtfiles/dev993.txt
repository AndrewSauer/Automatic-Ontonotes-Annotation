The Royal Arsenal , Woolwich carried out armaments manufacture , ammunition proofing , and explosives research for the British armed forces at a site on the south bank of the River Thames in Woolwich in south - east London , England , United Kingdom . 

It was originally known as the Woolwich Warren , having begun on land previously used as a domestic warren in the grounds of a Tudor house , Tower Place . 

Much of the initial history of the site is linked with that of the Board of Ordnance , which purchased the Warren in the late 17th century in order to expand an earlier base at Gun Wharf in Woolwich Dockyard . 

Over the next two centuries , as operations grew and innovations were pursued , the site expanded massively ; at the time of the First World War the Arsenal covered and employed close to 80,000 people . 

Thereafter its operations were scaled down ; it finally closed as a factory in 1967 and the Ministry of Defence moved out in 1994 . 

Today the area , so long a secret enclave , is open to the public and is being redeveloped for housing and community use .
