In English church history , a nonconformist was a Protestant who did not " conform " to the governance and usages of the established Church of England . 

Broad use of the term was precipitated after the Restoration of the British monarchy in 1660 , when the Act of Uniformity 1662 re - established the opponents of reform within the Church of England . 

By the late 19th century the term specifically included the Reformed Christians ( Presbyterians , Congregationalists and other Calvinist sects ) , plus the Baptists and Methodists . 

The English Dissenters such as the Puritans who violated the Act of Uniformity 1559—typically by practising radical , sometimes separatist , dissent — were retrospectively labelled as nonconformists . 

By law and social custom , nonconformists were restricted from many spheres of public life — not least , from access to public office , civil service careers , or degrees at university — and were referred to as suffering from civil disabilities . 

In England and Wales in the late 19th century the new terms " free churchman " and " Free Church " started to replace " dissenter " or " Nonconformist " . 

One influential nonconformist minister was Matthew Henry , who beginning in 1710 published his multi - volume Commentary that is still used and available in the 21st century . 

Isaac Watts is an equally recognized nonconformist minister whose hymns are still sung by Christians worldwide .
