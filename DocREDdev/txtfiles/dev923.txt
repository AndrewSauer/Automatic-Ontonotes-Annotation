Joseph Reid Anderson ( February 16 , 1813 â€“ September 7 , 1892 ) was an American civil engineer , industrialist , politician and soldier . 

During the American Civil War he served as a Confederate general , and his Tredegar Iron Company was a major source of munitions and ordnance for the Confederate States Army . 

Starting with a small forge and rolling mill in the mid-1830s , It was a flourishing operation by 1843 when he leased it . 

He eventually bought the company outright in 1848 and forcefully and aggressively built Tredegar Iron Works into the South 's largest and most significant iron works . 

When the Civil War broke out he entered the Army as a Brigadier General in 1861 . 

Shortly after he was wounded and then resigned from the Army returning to the iron works . 

It was the Confederacy 's major ( and for much of the war only ) source of cannons and munitions , employing some 900 workers , most of whom were slaves . 

His plant was confiscated by the Union army at the end of the war , but returned to him in 1867 and he remained president until his death . 

Anderson was very active in local civic and political affairs .
