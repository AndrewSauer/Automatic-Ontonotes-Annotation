Le Ventre de Paris ( 1873 ) is the third novel in Émile Zola 's twenty - volume series Les Rougon - Macquart . 

It is set in and around Les Halles , the enormous , busy central market of 19th - century Paris . 

Les Halles , rebuilt in cast iron and glass during the Second Empire was a landmark of modernity in the city , the wholesale and retail center of a thriving food industry . 

Le Ventre de Paris ( translated into English under many variant titles but literally meaning The Belly of Paris ) is Zola 's first novel entirely on the working class . 

The protagonist is Florent , an escaped political prisoner mistakenly arrested after the French coup of 1851 . 

He returns to his step - brother Quenu , a charcutier and his wife Lisa Quenu ( formerly Macquart ) , with whom he finds refuge . 

They get him a job in the market as a fish inspector . 

After getting mixed up in an ineffectual socialist plot against the Empire , Florent is arrested and deported again . 

Although Zola had yet to hone his mastery of working - class speech and idioms displayed to such good effect in L'Assommoir , the novel conveys a powerful atmosphere of life in the great market halls and of working class suffering . 

There are a number of vivid descriptive passages , the most famous of which , his description of the olfactory sensations experienced upon entering a cheese shop , has become known as the " Cheese Symphony " due to its ingenious orchestral metaphors . 

Throughout the book , the painter Claude Lantier , a relative of the Macquarts and later the protagonist of L'Œuvre ( 1886 ) - shows up to provide a semi - authorial commentary , playing the role of chorus . 

It is an interesting and often powerful work , though not usually considered as being on a par with the novelist 's achievements later in the Rougon - Macquart cycle .
