Cesare Mori ( Pavia , December 22 , 1871 â€“ Udine , July 6 , 1942 ) was a prefect ( prefetto ) before and during the Fascist period in Italy . 

He is known in Italy as the " Iron Prefect " ( Prefetto di Ferro ) because of his iron - fisted campaigns against the Mafia in Sicily in the second half of the 1920s . 

He is widely regarded as a fascist , even though at the beginning of Italy 's fascist dictatorship he arrested both fascists and socialists when he was prefect of Bologna . 

He officially joined the Fascist National Party only in 1926 . 

He was probably an officer who did n't have any strong political beliefs and who exhibited courage , dedication and integrity in the defense of the state and its institutions especially in combating the Mafia in Sicily . 

Nonetheless , the fight against the Mafia carried out by Cesare Mori proved to be effective mainly due to the special powers granted to him by Benito Mussolini when he was prefect in Sicily . 

Italian film director Pasquale Squitieri made a movie in 1977 --- Il prefetto di ferro --- about his fight against the Mafia when he was prefect in Sicily .
