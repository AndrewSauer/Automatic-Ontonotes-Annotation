The song was written by Lavigne , David Hodges , Chad Kroeger , Jacob Kasher Hindlin , Rickard B. GÃ¶ransson and Peter Svensson and was produced by Peter Svensson . 

" Rock n Roll " is an upbeat pop punk song , and lyrically it is a declaration of rebellion on which the singer puts up her " middle finger to the sky " to " let 'em know that she 's still rock and roll , " refusing to behave like an adult . 

The song received a critical praise from music critics , and was highlighted as one of the standout tracks on the album . 

" Rock n Roll " performed moderately on the charts , reaching number one in South Korea and Taiwan , and number five in Japan , respectively . 

The song failed to make impact elsewhere , peaking at number 37 in Canada and number 91 on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart . 

The music video directed by Chris Marrs Piliero shows Lavigne in full combat mode , conspiring with Danica McKellar ( playing a character called Winnie Cooperre ) in an attempt to " save rock and roll " .
