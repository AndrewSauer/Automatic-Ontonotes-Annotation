In 1913 , during the silent era , Barattolo founded Caesar Film . 

Caesar made a series of popular films , some of which starred Francesca Bertini . 

In 1919 he joined and became an influential figure at the conglomerate Unione Cinematografica Italiana which dominated Italian film production during the early 1920s , but this came to an end following the box office failure of Quo Vadis ( 1924 ) . 

In the early 1930s he tried to re - establish Caesar Film as a serious force in Italian production , but this also failed . 

During the 1930s , Barattolo lobbied the Fascist government of Italy for aid to rebuild the Italian film industry .
