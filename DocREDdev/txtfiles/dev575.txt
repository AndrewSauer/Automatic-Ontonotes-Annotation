Vicente Genaro de Quesada ( 1782 Havana , Cuba â€“ 15 August 1836 Madrid ) was a Spanish military figure . 

He participated in the Battle of Burgos ( 1808 ) during the Peninsular War , leading the Royal Guard and Walloon Guard . 

Forming a rearguard for the shattered Spanish lines , these troops absorbed repeated charges by General Lasalle 's French cavalry without yielding any ground . 

He later fought in the First Carlist War on the Isabeline ( Liberal ) side , losing the Battle of Alsasua in April 1834 . 

After the Mutiny of La Granja in August 1836 , he tried to suppress demonstrations in Madrid in support of restoring the Constitution of 1812 . 

The next day , with the queen regent having acceded to the demands of the mutineers , he fled to the village of Hortaleza , but was captured and killed there by a crowd including members of the National Militia .
