Kondor was the fifth of six Type 23 torpedo boats built for the German Navy ( initially called the Reichsmarine and then renamed as the Kriegsmarine in 1935 ) . 

The boat made multiple non - intervention patrols during the Spanish Civil War in the late 1930s . 

During World War II , she played a minor role in the attack on Oslo , the capital of Norway , during the Norwegian Campaign of 1940 . 

Kondor spent the next several months escorting minelayers as they laid minefields and damaged heavy ships back to Germany before she was transferred to France around September . 

She started laying minefields herself that month and continued to do so for the rest of the war . 

The boat returned to France in 1942 and helped to escort blockade runners , commerce raiders and submarines through the English Channel and the Bay of Biscay . 

Damaged by a mine shortly before the Allied Invasion of Normandy in June 1944 , Kondor was under repair on the day of the landings . 

Recognizing that she could not be repaired quickly , the boat was decommissioned later that month and was then further damaged by British bombers so that she was declared a constructive total loss .
