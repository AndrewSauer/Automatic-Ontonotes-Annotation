The Navy , Army and Air Force Institutes ( NAAFI ) is an organisation created by the British government in 1921 to run recreational establishments needed by the British Armed Forces , and to sell goods to servicemen and their families . 

It runs clubs , bars , shops , supermarkets , launderettes , restaurants , caf√©s and other facilities on most British military bases and also canteens on board Royal Navy ships . 

Commissioned officers are not usually supposed to use the NAAFI clubs and bars , since their messes provide these facilities and their entry , except on official business , is considered to be an intrusion into junior ranks ' private lives . 

NAAFI personnel serving aboard ship are part of the Naval Canteen Service ( NCS ) , wear naval uniform and have action stations , but remain ordinary civilians . 

NAAFI personnel can also join the Expeditionary Force Institutes ( EFI ) , which provides NAAFI facilities in war zones . 

EFI personnel are members of the Territorial Army serving on special engagements , bear ranks and wear uniform . 

NCS personnel can similarly volunteer to join the Royal Navy when it goes on active service . 

Petty Officer John Leake , NCS canteen manager in HMS Ardent , was awarded the Distinguished Service Medal ( DSM ) in the 1982 Falklands War for his courage while manning a machine gun .
