The Orongorongo River runs for southwest through the Orongorongo Valley in the southern Rimutaka Ranges of the North Island of New Zealand . 

The river and its associated catchments lie within the bounds of the Rimutaka Forest Park , which is administered by the Department of Conservation . 

Orongorongo River is the main artery of the Rimutaka Range , draining an area with rainfall of up to a year , which is twice as much as the rainfall at the mouth of the river at Cook Strait . 

For much of its course the river is a braided river , with a wide bed of greywacke shingle and gravel and a number of streams of water . 

The gravel bed can be seen as light - coloured areas of varying width in the adjacent image . 

Because the rainfall in the Rimutaka Range often comes in high - intensity rainstorms , the river is prone to violent floods . 

The most severe of these floods sweep away most of the river 's vegetated islands every 15 to 20 years . 

Between these floods , the shingle islands are gradually colonised by various low growing plants , followed by a host of native shrubs such as tauhinu and manuka , and eventually small trees .
