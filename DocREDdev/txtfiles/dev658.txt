The Cambodia â€“ Vietnam Friendship Monument in Phnom Penh , capital of Cambodia , is a large concrete monument commemorating the former alliance between Vietnam and Cambodia . 

It was built in the late 1970s by the communist regime that took power after the Cambodian - Vietnamese War , which overthrew the Khmer Rouge regime . 

The monument is located at the Botum Park near the centre of Phnom Penh not far from the Royal Palace . 

It features heroic statues of Vietnamese and Cambodian soldiers in the " Socialist realist " style developed in the Soviet Union in the 1930s , together with images of a woman and baby representing Cambodian civilians . 

The monument is in a popular park in the middle of the city . 

The monument has occasionally become a political focal point . 

On August 30 , 1998 , during post - electoral protests , several people climbed onto the monument with hammers , poured gasoline on it and set it on fire . 

This damage was repaired two months later by the authorities . 

On July 29 , 2007 , a bomb exploded at the base of the monument , causing little damage .
