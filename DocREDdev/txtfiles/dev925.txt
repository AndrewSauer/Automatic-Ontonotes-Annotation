" The Archbishop " is the third episode of the first series of the BBC sitcom Blackadder ( The Black Adder ) . 

It is set in England in the late 15th century , and follows the exploits of the fictitious Prince Edmund as he is invested as Archbishop of Canterbury amid a Machiavellian plot by the King to acquire lands from the Catholic Church . 

Most of the humour in the episode relies on religious satire . 

The script pays tribute to the real - life 12th century Archbishop of Canterbury , Thomas Becket . 

Edmund , faced with the threat of assassination , attempts to escape to France into self - imposed exile ; and in a later scene , two drunk knights overhear King Richard IV exclaiming " Who will rid me of this turbulent priest ? 

" , the words attributed to King Henry II which led to Becket 's death in 1170 , and embark on a mission to murder Edmund . 

" The Archbishop " won an International Emmy Award in 1983 in the Popular Arts category . 

The Catholic Church was to be satirized again in the second series , Blackadder II , in the 1986 episode " Money " .
