The is a subregion of the Chūbu region and Kansai region in Japan that runs along the Pacific Ocean . 

The name comes from the Tōkaidō , one of the Edo Five Routes . 

Because Tōkai is a sub - region and is not officially classified , there is some disagreement about where exactly the region begins and ends , however Japanese maps widely conclude that the region includes Shizuoka , Aichi , Gifu and Mie prefectures . 

The largest major city in the region is Nagoya and the Chūkyō Metropolitan Area ( Nagoya Metropolitan Area ) makes up a large portion of the region and has Japan 's third strongest economy . 

The business influence of this urban area sometimes extends out into the outlying areas of the three prefectures centered on Nagoya which are Aichi , Gifu , and Mie ; this area is sometimes referred to as the Chūkyō region . 

Tōkai is a heavy manufacturing area and is one of the most industrial regions in Japan . 

Its coast is lined with densely populated cities with economies that thrive on factories . 

The Tōkai region has experienced a number of large earthquakes in the past , including the two great earthquakes in 1944 ( also known as the " Tonankai earthquake " ) and 1945 ( also known as the " Mikawa earthquake " ) . 

Following the work of Kiyoo Mogi , it is predicted that there is a possibility that the area will be subject to a shallow magnitude 8.0 earthquake in the near future . 

Nagoya , Shizuoka , and other large cities would be greatly damaged , with potential casualties in the tens of thousands . 

The Coordinating Committee for Earthquake Prediction designated the region as an Area of Specific Observation in 1970 , and upgraded it to an Area of Intensified Observation in 1974 .
