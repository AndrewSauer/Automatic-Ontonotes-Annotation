The Scribe is a 1966 comedy film short starring Buster Keaton in his last film role before his death from lung cancer on February 1 , 1966 . 

It was produced by the Construction Safety Association of Ontario , Canada to promote Construction site safety , and was filmed where the Ontario Government Buildings were under construction in Toronto . 

The director was John Sebert . 

Keaton portrays the janitor at a newspaper who accidentally intercepts a call from the editor , ordering him to do a story about safety practices at a massive construction site . 

He sneaks onto the construction site and finds a list of 16 safety rules posted on a wall . 

He takes the list and attempts to confront workers when he sees them acting in an unsafe manner , often causing more accidents than he prevents . 

Keaton is silent throughout the film as he recreates several routines from his youth . 

Most notable was his recreation of a gag from his 1918 film The Bell Boy in which he mops the floor using only the tip of the mop , little by little while sitting on the floor .
