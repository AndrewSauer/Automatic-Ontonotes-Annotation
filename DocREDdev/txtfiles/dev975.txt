In the New York metropolitan area , the Metropolitan Transportation Authority ( MTA ) runs the New York City Subway , which is mostly manually operated . 

The subway system currently uses Automatic Block Signaling with fixed wayside signals and automatic train stops . 

Many portions of the signaling system were installed between the 1930s and 1960s . 

Because of the age of the subway system , some replacement parts must be custom built for the MTA , as they are otherwise unavailable from signaling suppliers . 

Additionally , some subway services have reached their train capacity limits and can not operate extra trains with the current system . 

There are two different schemes of signaling in the system . 

The most used scheme is found on all of the B Division , which consists of lines originally built to the Brooklyn – Manhattan Transit Corporation ( BMT ) and Independent Subway System ( IND ) 's wider specifications , as well as on most of the A Division , which consists of lines built to the narrower specifications of the Interborough Rapid Transit Company ( IRT ) . 

An older system was used on all of the A Division , but with the conversion of the IRT Dyre Avenue Line signals to the B Division scheme , this system is no longer in use . 

As part of the modernization of the New York City Subway , the MTA has plans to upgrade much of the system with communications - based train control ( CBTC ) technology , which will control the speed and starting and stopping of subway trains . 

The CBTC system is mostly automated and uses a moving block system – which reduces headways between trains , increases train frequencies and capacities , and relays the trains ' positions to a control room – rather than a fixed block system . 

This will require new rolling stock to be built for the subway system , as only newer trains can use CBTC .
