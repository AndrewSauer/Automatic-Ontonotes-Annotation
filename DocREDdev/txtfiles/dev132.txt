L'École des officiers de la gendarmerie nationale , the French Gendarmerie nationale Officers School , was created in 1901 and based in the Schomberg barracks in Paris . 

At the time it was simply to give additional training to NCOs likely to enter the officer corps . 

In 1918 , following the First World War , the school moved to Versailles and diversified by including in its ranks officers from other armies . 

It was not until 1937 that the school was given a flag . 

This emblem was officially handed over to the chef de corps , Colonel Picot , 14 July 1937 , on the Champs - Élysées by the President Albert Lebrun . 

During the Second World War , the school moved to Pau then back to Paris before finding its current home in the Augereau barracks in Melun on 1 October 1945 .
