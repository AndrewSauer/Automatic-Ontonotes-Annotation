The Ålgård Line ( ) is a closed , but not abandoned , railway line between Ganddal and Ålgård in Rogaland , Norway . 

The line was built as a narrow gauge branch line of the Jæren Line by the Norwegian State Railways ( NSB ) and opened in 1924 . 

It runs through the villages of Foss - Eikeland and Figgjo in Sandnes to Ålgård in Gjesdal . 

Several proposals were made for the Ålgård Line to become the first part of the main line from Stavanger to Oslo , but instead the Sørlandet Line was connected to the Jæren Line in 1944 . 

At the same time , the Ålgård Line was upgraded to standard gauge . 

The line had up to ten daily round trips with diesel multiple units , until passenger traffic was terminated in 1955 . 

Freight traffic remained until 1988 , when most of the line was abandoned in 1988 , although was used until 2001 . 

The line is owned by the Norwegian National Rail Administration . 

The station at Figgjo has been converted to a museum , and the section from there to Ålgård is used for recreational draisines . 

There have been proposals to reopen the line either as part of the Jæren Commuter Rail or the planned light rail for Greater Stavanger .
