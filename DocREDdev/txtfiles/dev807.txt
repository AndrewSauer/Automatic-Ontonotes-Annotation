Carl Buchheister ( 17 October 1890 â€“ 2 February 1964 ) was a German constructivist artist noted for his multiple series of " model paintings " at Galerie Lambert Weyl , Paris . 

which he began in 1925 . 

He was born in Hanover , Germany . 

Although he was not officially part of the Bauhaus movement , Buchheister was a close friend of Wassily Kandinsky and paralleled many of the social and artistic goals of the Bauhaus school . 

With regard to constructivism , Buchheister was typically more playful and improvisational than his contemporaries , becoming interested in the Dada movement after a collaboration with Kurt Schwitters in the late 1920s which led him to incorporate more varied materials such as acrylic glass , aluminum , wood , and twine into his compositions . 

This direction was given much freer rein after World War II and the end of Nazism . 

He died in Hanover in 1964 .
