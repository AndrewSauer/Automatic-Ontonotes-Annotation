The Ellerbusch Site ( 12-W-56 ) is a small but significant archaeological site in the southwestern part of the U.S. state of Indiana . 

Unlike many sites created by people of the same culture , it occupies an upland site near a major river floodplain . 

Its existence appears to have been the result of the coincidence of periods of peace and growth in the related Angel Site , which led some townspeople to leave their homes for new villages that were more convenient for resource gathering . 

Researched partly because of its small size , Ellerbusch has produced information that greatly increases present awareness of other small sites and of its culture 's overall patterns of settlement in the region . 

Because of its archaeological value , the site was declared a historic site in the late twentieth century .
