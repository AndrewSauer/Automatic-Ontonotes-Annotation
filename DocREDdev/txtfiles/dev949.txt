Mount Shinn is a mountain 4,661 meters in elevation , standing 6   km ( 4   miles ) southeast of Mount Tyree in the Sentinel Range , Ellsworth Mountains in Antarctica . 

It surmounts Ramorino Glacier to the north , upper Crosswell Glacier to the northeast , Goodge Col to the southeast , and Branscomb Glacier to the south - southwest . 

The peak was discovered on IGY reconnaissance flights in January 1958 , and named by the Advisory Committee on Antarctic Names ( US - ACAN ) for Lieutenant Commander Conrad S. ( Gus ) Shinn , U.S. Navy , a pilot on some of these flights . 

Shinn was pilot of the Navy R4D aircraft carrying Admiral Dufek which , on October 31 , 1956 , made the first plane landing at the geographic South Pole . 

It had been thought to be over 4800 m high , but was re - measured in 2001 by Damien Gildea and Rodrigo Fica of the Omega Foundation , using a Trimble 5700 GPS receiver and the Australian government 's AUSPOS processing system .
