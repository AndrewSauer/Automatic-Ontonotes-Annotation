A life - size bronze statue of Jan Smuts by the British artist Jacob Epstein stands on the north side of Parliament Square in London , United Kingdom , between a statue of Lord Palmerston and a statue of David Lloyd George . 

Smuts served as an army general and as a member of the Imperial War Cabinet in the First World War , and then served as Prime Minister of South Africa twice , from 1919 to 1924 and from then 1939 to 1948 . 

The statue depicts him in his military uniform as a field marshal , leaning forward with his left leg advanced , as if walking forward . 

The statue stands on a pedestal of granite from South Africa , which bears the inscription . 

After Winston Churchill won the 1951 UK general election in October 1951 , he proposed erecting a statue in Parliament Square as a memorial to Smuts , who had died in September 1950 . 

Churchill retired as prime minister in 1955 , and was too ill to perform the unveiling in November 1956 ; it was unveiled instead by the Speaker of the House of Commons , William Morrison . 

The statue became a Grade II listed building in 1970 .
