The Australia – Chile Free Trade Agreement is a trade agreement between the countries of Chile and Australia . 

It was signed on July 30 , 2008 and went into effect in the 1st quarter of 2009 . 

The agreement was intended to go into effect on January 1 , 2009 , but was delayed due to Chile not being able to finish its ratification in time . 

Trade between Chile and Australia is modest , involving $ 856 m in 2007 . 

Australia is the fourth largest provider of foreign direct investment in Chile with over $ 3 billion in 2007 . 

Chile ranks as Australia 's 41st trading partner . 

Australia 's main exports to Chile were coal ( $ 94 million ) and civil engineering equipment ( $ 21 million ) . 

Trade from Chile is copper ( $ 96 million ) , and pulp and waste paper ( $ 57 million ) . 

When enacted , the Agreement calls for Chile to eliminate tariffs on 91.9 % of tariffs which cover 96.9 % of trade from Australia . 

Australia will cut 90.8 % of tariffs which cover 97.1 % of trade from Chile . 

By year six of the Agreement ( 2015 ) , all tariffs will be discarded except for Chile 's sugar tariff which will remain subject to its current ‘ price band’ system . 

The tariffs in Australia , that will stay in place until 2015 , will be relating to textile and the clothing industry along with table grapes . 

In Chile , the agreement will protect the textile and clothing industry and some other manufactured products . 

According to the Australian Government , the government hopes to use the Agreement as a model for other free trade agreements with other countries . 

Before passage of the Agreement farmers and horticulturists protested the Agreement in front of the Australian Parliament . 

The protesters claim that this agreement would undercut Australian food producers by allowing in cheap food goods from Chile . 

Simon Crean , Australia 's Minister for Trade , responded to the farmers concerns by stating that tariffs are quite low or in some cases nonexistent due to previous international trade agreements . 

Chile and Australia agreed in principle to start negotiations on December 8 , 2006 . 

Negotiations started on July 18 , 2007 and after four rounds of talks , concluded on May 27 , 2008 .
