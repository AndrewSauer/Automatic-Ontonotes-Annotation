Fyns Hoved is a bight of northeastern Funen , Denmark , curving south to form the approach to Odense Fjord . 

It is the northernmost point of Hindsholm and is thus Funen 's northernmost point , dividing the Kattegat and the Great Belt . 

The eastern side of the bight between Fyns Hoved and Skoven , to the south , is irregular , with a beach and hills behind it , and to the south of the bight is a small , shallow bay , Korshavn Bay , with the Korshavn Light in the vicinity . 

The bay is a natural harbour used by many yachtsmen . 

Fyns Hoved is located in the dry Great Belt region , where rainfall is about per year compared to the national average of per year . 

This makes it hospitable to plants that are more common in the dry areas of southern Europe . 

The area is frequented by many shore birds and is also a resting place for migrating birds , and harbour porpoises can be seen offshore . 

Numerous artists such as Theodor Philipsen , Johannes Larsen and Fritz Syberg have found inspiration in the light and the scenery . 

There are many stone walls in the area ; these date back to 1810 , when the seven farmers in the village of Nordskov decided to divide the area between them so that they would each have one northern and one southern strip of land . 

The seven cottagers had to content themselves with sharing one strip . 

During the German occupation , barracks , a radar installation and artillery on Fyns Hoved guarded the entrance to the Great Belt .
