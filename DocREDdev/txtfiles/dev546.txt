United States Naval Forces Germany ( NAVFORGER ) was a command of the United States Navy , active from 1944 to 1958 . 

It also had the designation Task Force 104 ( TF-104 ) . 

NAVFORGER was responsible for all US naval activities in Germany . 

Its first commander was Vice Admiral Robert L. Ghormley ( 1944 â€“ 45 ) . 

After the formation of the command , it was first necessary to take under U.S. control the German warships assigned to the U.S. as war prizes ( for example , the heavy cruiser Prinz Eugen ) . 

To this end , in Bremerhaven , a Naval Service Unit ( MDG ) was established . 

After the initial , purely administrative order , the settlement of the German Kriegsmarine and the merchant navy was in cooperation with the other allies , finished , the command was greatly reduced . 

It was intended to completely dissolve the command in 1948 . 

However , the American military governor General Lucius D. Clay and since July 1948 COMNAVFORGER Rear Admiral Wilkes convinced the leadership in Washington to leave some naval forces in Germany . 

The now allotted backup and reconnaissance tasks were to deal with three main elements : the Naval Advanced Base Bremerhaven , the Rhine River Patrol and the Intelligence Unit stationed in Berlin . 

The tasks also included the supervision and management of commercial shipping on the inland waters of the United States Zone .
