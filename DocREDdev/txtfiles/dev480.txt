Berge Meere und Giganten ( Mountains Seas and Giants ) is a 1924 science fiction novel by German author Alfred Döblin . 

Stylistically and structurally experimental , the novel follows the development of human society into the 27th century and depicts global - scale conflicts between future polities , technologies , and natural forces , culminating in the catastrophic harvesting of Iceland 's volcanic energy in order to melt Greenland 's ice cap . 

Among critics , Berge Meere und Giganten has the reputation of being a difficult and polarizing novel , and has not received nearly as much attention as Döblin 's following novel , Berlin Alexanderplatz ( 1929 ) . 

Inspired by the mundane sight of pebbles rolling in the Baltic Sea surf in the summer of 1921 , Döblin began writing Berge Meere und Giganten that fall , conducting extensive research into various natural and human sciences in the process . 

Although he had originally conceived of it as a hymn to the city and technology , over the course of writing the novel it evolved into a tribute to the power of nature . 

He finished the manuscript in the summer of 1923 , and it was published by Fischer Verlag the following year .
