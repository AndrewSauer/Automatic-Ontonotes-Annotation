The O. W. Coburn School of Law was the law school of Oral Roberts University . 

The school was named after donor Orin Wesley Coburn , the founder of Coburn Optical Industries and the father of future US politician Tom Coburn . 

The school opened in 1979 . 

Its founding dean was Charles Kothe , a Tulsa , Oklahoma labor attorney . 

Other professors included Anita Hill , John Eidsmoe , Gary Lane , Herb Titus , and Rutherford Institute founder John W. Whitehead . 

In 1986 , the school closed , with its 190,000 volume law library , as well as 5 professors and 23 students , moving to CBN University ( now Regent University ) . 

Since the new CBN law school would not initially be accredited ( and in fact did not receive provisional accreditation until 1989 ) , students graduating in spring 1987 were allowed to state they graduated from Coburn , in order to be listed as graduating from an accredited school . 

U.S. Representative Michele Bachmann began attending Coburn the first year it opened , and graduated as part of its last class .
