Trane 's Blues is a compact disc credited to the jazz musician John Coltrane , released in 1999 on Blue Note Records , catalogue 98240 . 

It comprises recordings from sessions for Blue Note and United Artists Records as a sideman for Paul Chambers , Sonny Clark , Johnny Griffin , and Cecil Taylor that were issued respectively on their Whims of Chambers , Sonny 's Crib , A Blowin ' Session , and Hard Driving Jazz albums . 

Two selections are from Coltrane 's own 1957 Blue Train , and " One for Four " had been previously unissued . 

" Trane 's Blues " had been issued on the compilation High Step in 1975 , previously known as " John Paul Jones " and named after himself , the bass player Chambers , and the drummer Philly Joe Jones . 

Like Prestige Records before them , as Coltrane 's fame grew long after he had stopped recording for the label , Blue Note used varied recordings , often those where Coltrane had been merely a sideman , and reissued them as a new album with Coltrane 's name prominently displayed . 

In this case , the Big Four conglomerate EMI continued that earlier practice .
