Alexeni is a commune in Ialomița County , Romania , some 65   km north - east of Bucharest , near the town of Urziceni . 

It is composed of a single village , Alexeni . 

Until 2001 a Romanian Air Force military helicopters unit was located at the nearby airfield . In 2007 , as the airfield was not used by the Romanian Air Force anylonger , the former Minister of Transport Radu Berceanu suggested to use the location for Bucharest 's new low - cost flights airport(as the operational tariffs for Bucharest 's previous low - cost hub , Aurel Vlaicu Airport , were set to grow ) . 

However , some analysts considered the project unrealistic and doomed to fail due to the poor conditions of the infrastructure in the area . 

Eventually those plans were abandoned and all low - cost flights were moved in March 2012 at Bucharest main airport Henri Coandă International Airport .
