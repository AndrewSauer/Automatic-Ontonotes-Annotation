Antisemitic canards are unfounded rumors or false allegations which are defamatory towards Judaism as a religion , or defamatory towards Jews as an ethnic or religious group . 

They often form part of broader theories of Jewish conspiracies . 

According to defense attorney Kenneth Stern , " Historically , Jews have not fared well around conspiracy theories . 

Such ideas fuel anti - Semitism . 

The myths that all Jews are responsible for the death of Christ , or poisoned wells , or killed Christian children to bake matzos , or " made up " the Holocaust , or plot to control the world , do not succeed each other ; rather , the list of anti - Semitic canards gets longer . " 

Some antisemitic canards date back to the birth of Christianity , while some conspiracy theories are more recent . 

Since at least the Middle Ages , antisemitism has featured elements of conspiracy theory . 

In medieval Europe it was widely believed that Jews poisoned wells , had been responsible for the death of Jesus , and ritually consumed the blood of Christians . 

The second half of the 19th century saw the emergence of notions that Jews and/or Freemasons were plotting to establish control over the world . 

Forged evidence has been presented to spread the notion that Jews were responsible for the propagation of Communism , the most notorious example being The Protocols of the Elders of Zion ( 1903 ) . 

Such antisemitic conspiracy theories became central to the worldview of Adolf Hitler . 

Antisemitic theories persist today in notions concerning banking , Hollywood , the news media and a purported Zionist Occupation Government . 

Holocaust denial is also considered an antisemitic conspiracy theory because of its position that the Holocaust is a hoax designed to advance the interests of Jews and justify the creation of the State of Israel .
