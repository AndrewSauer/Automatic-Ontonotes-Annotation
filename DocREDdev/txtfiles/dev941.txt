The Upper Ammonoosuc River is a tributary of the Connecticut River that flows through Co√∂s County in northern part of the northeastern U.S. state of New Hampshire . 

Despite its name , the river is not an upstream portion of the Ammonoosuc River , but instead a separate tributary of the Connecticut River flowing from to the north of the Ammonoosuc . 

The Upper Ammonoosuc rises in Pond of Safety in the town of Randolph , runs first generally north through rural portions of Berlin ( where it flows through the Godfrey Dam ) , Milan and a corner of Dummer , then west through Stark and then Northumberland where it drains into the Connecticut near the village of Groveton . 

The end points of that course are approximately 25 air miles ( 38 km ) apart . 

From Milan to Groveton it is fairly closely paralleled by New Hampshire Route 110 . 

Fort Wentworth was built in 1755 at the junction of the Upper Ammonoosuc and the Connecticut Rivers ( now near the village of Groveton ) . 

The fort was used sporadically during both the French and Indian War and the American Revolutionary War . 

The watershed area includes the northern Crescent Range , eastern Pliny Range and the eastern and northern Pilot Range , all in the White Mountains .
