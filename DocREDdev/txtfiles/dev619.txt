Municipal elections in Canada fall within the jurisdiction of the various provinces and territories , who usually hold their municipal elections on the same date every two , three or four years , depending on the location . 

Each province has its own nomenclature for municipalities and some have local elections for unincorporated areas which are not technically municipalities . 

These entities can be called cities , towns , villages , townships , hamlets , parishes and , simply , municipalities , county municipalities , regional county municipalities , municipal districts , regional districts , counties , regional municipalities , specialized municipalities , district municipalities or rural municipalities . 

Many of these may be used by Statistics Canada as the basis for census divisions or census subdivisions . 

Municipal elections usually elect a mayor and city council and often also a school board . 

Some locations may also elect other bodies , such as Vancouver , which elects its own parks board . 

Some municipalities will also hold referenda or ballot initiatives at the same time , usually relating to spending projects or tax changes . 

Elections for city councils are held through either a ward system or at - large system , depending on the location . 

Vancouver is the largest city in Canada to use the at - large system , while most other larger cities use wards . 

Most councils are non - partisan and elect only independents . 

However , some municipalities have locally based political parties or election slates . 

These include Montreal , Quebec City and Longueuil in Quebec and Vancouver , Victoria , Surrey and Richmond in British Columbia . 

These local parties are rarely affiliated with any provincial or federal parties . 

Voting may be done with paper ballots that are hand - counted , or by various forms of electronic voting .
