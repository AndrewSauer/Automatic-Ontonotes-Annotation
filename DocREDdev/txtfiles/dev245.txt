Life in Color is a United States - based EDM event company , best known for their ongoing " paint party " Life in Color concert tours . 

The company was founded by Sebastian Solano , Paul Campbell , Lukasz Tracz and Patryk Tracz as Committee Entertainment and the concert tour Dayglow in 2006 . 

Billed by its organizers as the " world 's largest paint party " , the tour features performances by electronic musicians , joined by artistic performers and the tour 's signature spraying of the audience with paint throughout the show . 

The company changed to its current name shortly after it was acquired by Robert F. X. Sillerman 's SFX Entertainment in late 2012 , with the original founders remaining as partners . 

Beginning in 2013 , the promotion began to produce Life in Color Festival , a music festival with multiple stages and a larger lineup of performers . 

Life in Color 's annual festival event in Miami is considered to be its flagship .
