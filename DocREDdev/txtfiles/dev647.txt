İspençe was a tax levied on non - Muslims in the Ottoman Empire . 

İspençe was a land - tax on non - Muslims in parts of the Ottoman Empire ; its counterpart , for Muslim taxpayers , was the resm - i çift - which was set at slightly lower rate . 

The treasury was well aware of the difference in tax takes , and the incentive to convert ; the legal reforms of Bayezid II halved some criminal penalties on nonmuslim taxpayers " so that the taxpayers shall not vanish " ; this rule was reconfimed , a century later , in 1587 . 

In other cases , local taxes were imposed on nonmuslims specifically to encourage conversion . 

İspençe had existed in the Balkans before the Ottoman conquest ; the Ottoman Empire typically adapted local taxes and institutions in each conquered area , leading to a patchwork of different taxes and rates . 

The concept of İspençe , theoretically a payment in lieu of corvee labour , was derived from the Byzantine " zeugaratikion " , a land tax based on the zeugarion - the area of farmland which could be ploughed by a pair of oxen . 

The zeugarion itself was taken up as the Ottoman " çift " , a word meaning " pair " .
