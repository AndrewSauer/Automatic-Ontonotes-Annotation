Marcial Maciel Degollado ( March 10 , 1920 – January 30 , 2008 ) was a Mexican Catholic priest who founded the Legion of Christ and the Regnum Christi movement , serving as general director of the legion from 1941 to 2005 . 

Throughout most of his career , he was respected within the church as " the greatest fundraiser of the modern Roman Catholic church " and as a prolific recruiter of new seminarians . 

Late in his life , Maciel was revealed to have sexually abused boys and young men . 

After his death , it came to light that he had also maintained relationships with at least two women , one of whom was a minor . 

He fathered as many as six children , and allegedly abused two of these children as well . 

In 2006 Pope Benedict XVI removed Maciel from active ministry based on the results of an investigation that he had started while head of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith , before his election as Pope in April 2005 . 

Maciel was ordered " to conduct a reserved life of prayer and penance , renouncing every public ministry " , and died in 2008 . 

On March 25 , 2010 , a communiqué on the legion 's website acknowledged as factual the " reprehensible actions " by Maciel , including sexual abuse of minor seminarians . 

In May 2010 the Vatican denounced Maciel 's actions and appointed a Papal Delegate to oversee the order and its governance .
