Andrea Lilio ( 1555 - 1642 ) was an Italian painter born in Ancona , hence he also is known as L'Anconitano . 

He painted mainly in his native city , as well as in Rome , where he was active from the beginning of the 17th century until around 1640 . 

He was employed by Pope Sixtus V in the decoration of the library of the Vatican and in the decoration of the Scala Santa in San Giovanni Laterano . 

In the latter , he painted , Moses striking the Rock and Moses with the Brazen Serpent . 

Said to have been a pupil of Federico Barocci , Lilio created a popular niche for himself by painting allegories for aristocratic audiences . 

In fact , it is altogether possible that Lilio collaborated for the illustrations of Cesare Ripa 's Iconologia , which was a popular source for such motifs for a very long time . 

He died at Ascoli Piceno . 

In a chapel of the Chiesa Nuova , he painted The Archangel Michael driving fallen angels from Heaven . 

He continued to ornament churches and convents of Rome during the reign of Pope Clement VIII . 

One of his masterpieces , the Martyrdom of Saint Lawrence , was painted for Santa Caterina in Ancona . 

He painted the Christ Washing the Feet of His Disciples for the nave of Santa Maria Maggiore in Rome . 

He also was part of the team active in the painting of the Sistine chapel ( chapel of Nativity ) in Santa Maria Maggiore . 

For the cathedral of Fano , he painted a picture of All Saints . 

Four new allegorical paintings by Lilio were identified in Milan 's Bagatti Valsecchi Museum , Milan .
