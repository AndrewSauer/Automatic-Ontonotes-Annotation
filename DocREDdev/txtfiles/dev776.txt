Booker Taliaferro Washington ( – November 14 , 1915 ) was an American educator , author , orator , and advisor to presidents of the United States . 

Between 1890 and 1915 , Washington was the dominant leader in the African - American community . 

Washington was from the last generation of black American leaders born into slavery and became the leading voice of the former slaves and their descendants . 

They were newly oppressed in the South by disenfranchisement and the Jim Crow discriminatory laws enacted in the post - Reconstruction Southern states in the late 19th and early 20th centuries . 

Washington was a key proponent of African - American businesses and one of the founders of the National Negro Business League . 

His base was the Tuskegee Institute , a historically black college in Alabama . 

As lynchings in the South reached a peak in 1895 , Washington gave a speech , known as the " Atlanta compromise " , which brought him national fame . 

He called for black progress through education and entrepreneurship , rather than trying to challenge directly the Jim Crow segregation and the disenfranchisement of black voters in the South . 

Washington mobilized a nationwide coalition of middle - class blacks , church leaders , and white philanthropists and politicians , with a long - term goal of building the community 's economic strength and pride by a focus on self - help and schooling . 

But , secretly , he also supported court challenges to segregation and restrictions on voter registration , passing on funds to the NAACP for this purpose . 

Black militants in the North , led by W.   E.   B. 

Du Bois , at first supported the Atlanta compromise but after 1909 , they set up the NAACP to work for political change . 

They tried with limited success to challenge Washington 's political machine for leadership in the black community but also built wider networks among white allies in the North . 

Decades after Washington 's death in 1915 , the civil rights movement of the 1950s took a more active and militant approach , which was also based on new grassroots organizations based in the South , such as CORE , SNCC and SCLC . 

Booker T. Washington mastered the nuances of the political arena in the late 19th century , which enabled him to manipulate the media , raise money , develop strategy , network , push , reward friends , and distribute funds , while punishing those who opposed his plans for uplifting blacks . 

His long - term goal was to end the disenfranchisement of the vast majority of African Americans , who then still lived in the South .
