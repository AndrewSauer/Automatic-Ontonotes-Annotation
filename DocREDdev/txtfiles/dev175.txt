The National Integrated Ballistic Information Network or NIBIN is a specialized computer network in the United States . 

It contains digital images of recovered pieces of ballistic evidence . 

Running on the Integrated Ballistic Identification System or IBIS platform , NIBIN enables U.S. law enforcers to rapidly determine if a piece of recovered ballistic evidence came from a firearm that has been previously used in a crime . 

There are certain criteria that must be met prior to entering information into the NIBIN database . 

For instance , cartridge cases from a .22 caliber firearm or a revolver are normally not entered . 

Using NIBIN , law enforcement staff can identify firearms in new cases that were used in prior incidents . 

A series of seventeen different Washington state crime scenes involving seven firearms , and three different agencies in two counties , was identified using information provided by IBIS / NIBIN .
