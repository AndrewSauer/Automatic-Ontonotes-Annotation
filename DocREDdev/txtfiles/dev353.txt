Lough Owel ( ) is a mesotrophic lough in the Midlands of Ireland , situated north of Mullingar , the county town of Westmeath . 

It has a maximum depth of 22 m . 

Water from Lough Owel feeds the Royal Canal , a canal crossing Ireland from Dublin to the River Shannon . 

Access to the lake can be gained from a carpark and pier to the south of the N4 Mullingar to Longford route . 

Lough Owel and Lough Ennell are two of many lakes that form the River Brosna drainage basin . 

The Brosna is a tributary of the Shannon , flowing through Mullingar and Kilbeggan , both in Westmeath , and from there through the town of Clara ( County Offaly ) into the Shannon . 

The Viking chieftain Turgesius was drowned in Lough Owel by Máel Sechnaill mac Maíl Ruanaid in 845 . 

Since 1996 the lough has received international protection as a Ramsar site . 

It is noted for its birdlife and is also well known amongst anglers , and holds a few char along with brown trout .
