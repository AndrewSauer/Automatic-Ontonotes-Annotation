The Robert Burns Fellowship , established in 1958 as a bicentennial celebration , is claimed to be New Zealand 's premier literary residency . 

The list of past fellows includes many of New Zealand 's most notable writers . 

The award was established by an anonymous group ( thought to have been instigated by Charles Brasch ) to be awarded each year to " writers of imaginative literature , including poetry , drama , fiction , autobiography , biography , essays or literary criticism . " 

The position is based at the University of Otago in Dunedin , New Zealand . 

It provides a year 's salary along with accommodation and an office for a writer in and around the university . 

Terms are for one year , although this may be extended to a second year in rare cases . 

The Robert Burns Fellowship is named after Scotland 's national poet Robert Burns . 

Dunedin is the city in New Zealand with the highest proportion of people of Scottish descent , and one of its founding fathers was Burns 's nephew Thomas Burns . 

To commemorate the 50th anniversary of the fellowship , a book - Nurse to the imagination : Fifty years of the Robert Burns Fellowship - was launched in October 2008 , along with commemorations to coincide with Dunedin 's 2008 Arts Festival .
