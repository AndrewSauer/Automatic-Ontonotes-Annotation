Glandularia , common name mock vervain or mock verbena , is a genus of annual and perennial herbaceous flowering plants in the family Verbenaceae . 

They are native to the Americas . 

Glandularia species are closely related to the true vervains and sometimes still included with them in Verbena . 

Horizontal chloroplast transfer occurred at least twice and possibly three times between these genera , which are otherwise too distinct to warrant unification . 

The discovery of the signal in the chloroplast genome was announced in 2008 by researchers from the University of Washington . 

Somehow , chloroplasts from V.   orcuttiana , swamp verbena ( V.   hastata ) or a close relative of these had admixed into the G.   bipinnatifida genome . 

Although hybridization runs rampant in the true and mock vervains – the ancestors of the well - known garden vervain are quite obscure – it does not seem to have been the cause of the cross - species gene transfer . 

In addition , the researchers discovered the signal of one more transfer event . 

This had introduced chloroplasts from an ancestral member of the Verbena lineage nowadays found in South America into Glandularia . 

Although all members of the present genus can be distinguished to have a chromosome count of five , the South American species are diploid , while polyploid hybrid Glandularia are very widespread from northern Central America northwards . 

The second genetic introgression must have occurred before the genus spread north , as species with the Verbena - like chloroplasts are found all over the Americas . 

Since the new chloroplast genes replaced the old ones , it may be that the possibly hybridogenic G.   bipinnatifida actually underwent horizontal chloroplast transfer twice in its evolutionary history .
