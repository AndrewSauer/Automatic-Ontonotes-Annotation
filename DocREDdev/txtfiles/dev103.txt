Oecophora bractella is a species of gelechioid moth . 

It belongs to the subfamily Oecophorinae of the concealer moth family ( Oecophoridae ) . 

As the type species of its genus Oecophora , its affiliations and phylogeny ( which are not completely known however ) determine the delimitation of that family and subfamily . 

It is native to Europe , where it inhabits woodland . 

The species is not often found in the outlying regions ; in the UK for example it has only been recorded from a few patches of old - growth forest in the English Midlands ( e.g. 

Wyre Forest ) , southern England , and southern Wales ( e.g. 

in the Wye valley ) . 

The adults ' wingspan is 12–16   mm . 

Conspicuously bicolored black and yellow , they also have some iridescent blue markings on the forewings . 

The adult moths fly from May to July depending on the location ; they are semi - diurnal and can be encountered during the day , but usually are active at dawn . 

The caterpillars feed on dead and decaying wood , and possibly also on fungi .
