Gwarn Music is an independent record label which was created in Manchester , England in 1991 . 

It was founded by former 52nd Street guitarist Tony Henry to release his then new music project FR’ Mystery ( lead vocalist Lorna Bailey ) after talks to sign the act to WEA in London broke down . 

The label was initially independently distributed by local city record shop Manchester Underground , before New Order manager Rob Gretton invited Henry to bring the label under the wing of his then new imprint Rob ’s Records in late 1994 . 

This was the second time in ten years that Henry and Gretton had worked together . 

Gretton was 52nd Street ’s A&R ; Manager at Factory Records . 

Gwarn Music is now the sole owner of all 52nd Street 's master copyrights released through Factory , A&M ; ( US ) and Profile Records ( US ) in the 1980s .
