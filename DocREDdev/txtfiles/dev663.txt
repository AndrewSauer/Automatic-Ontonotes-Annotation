The first South African to appear in an NFL regular season game , Anderson played in the league for 23 seasons with six teams . 

He spent the majority of his career with the Pittsburgh Steelers , but is also known for his tenure with the Minnesota Vikings . 

As a member of the Vikings in 1998 , Anderson became the first NFL kicker to have a perfect regular season , successfully making every field goal and point after touchdown during regular season play . 

However , Anderson 's accomplishment was overshadowed by a missed field goal in that year 's against the Atlanta Falcons , which is regarded as a primary factor in the Vikings ' subsequent defeat .
