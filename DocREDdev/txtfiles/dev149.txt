Brother Man ( 1954 ) is a novel by Jamaican Roger Mais , about a Messianic folk Rastafarian healer , ' Bra ' Man ' ( in dialect ) John Power . 

The book is significant as the first serious representation of the Rastafari movement in literature . 

Mais foresaw the defining power of the Rasta movement to Jamaican society 20 years before the era of Bob Marley and Reggae mainstream . 

It is also significant as an exploration of life in the ghetto of Kingston . 

It shows how the people relate to leaders , both making them deities and throwing them away when they fail to entertain them . 

The novel is written in prose with a layout that is seemingly cinematic and episodic ; little is done to describe the environment beyond the claustrophobic ghetto of ' The Lane ' in the slums of Kingston , Jamaica .
