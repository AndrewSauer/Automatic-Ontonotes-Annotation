Rudolf Halin ( February 3 , 1934 , Uerdingen – November 14 , 2014 , Mölln ) was a German graph theorist , known for defining the ends of infinite graphs , for Halin 's grid theorem , for extending Menger 's theorem to infinite graphs , and for his early research on treewidth and tree decomposition . 

He is also the namesake of Halin graphs , a class of planar graphs constructed from trees by adding a cycle through the leaves of the given tree ; earlier researchers had studied the subclass of cubic Halin graphs but Halin was the first to study this class of graphs in full generality . 

Halin earned his doctorate from the University of Cologne in 1962 , under the supervision of Klaus Wagner and Karl Dörge , after which he joined the faculty of the University of Hamburg . 

In February 1994 , a colloquium was held at the University of Hamburg in honor of Halin 's 60th birthday .
