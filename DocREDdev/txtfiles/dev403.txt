Pangaea Ultima ( also called Pangaea Proxima , Neopangaea , and Pangaea II ) is a possible future supercontinent configuration . 

Consistent with the supercontinent cycle , Pangaea Ultima could occur within the next 250 million years . 

This potential configuration , hypothesized by Christopher Scotese , earned its name from its similarity to the previous Pangaea supercontinent . 

Scotese later renamed Pangaea Ultima ( Last Pangaea ) to Pangaea Proxima ( Next Pangaea ) to alleviate confusion about the name Pangaea Ultima which could imply that it would be the last supercontinent . 

The concept was based on examination of past cycles of formation and breakup of supercontinents , not on current understanding of the mechanisms of tectonic change , which are too imprecise to project that far into the future . 

" It 's all pretty much fantasy to start with , " Scotese has said . 

" But it 's a fun exercise to think about what might happen . 

And you can only do it if you have a really clear idea of why things happen in the first place . " 

Supercontinents describe the merger of all , or nearly all , of the Earth 's landmass into a single contiguous continent . 

In the Pangaea Ultima scenario , subduction at the western Atlantic , east of the Americas , leads to the subduction of the Atlantic mid - ocean ridge followed by subduction destroying the Atlantic and Indian basin , causing the Atlantic and Indian Oceans to close , bringing the Americas back together with Africa and Europe . 

As with most supercontinents , the interior of Pangaea Proxima would probably become a semi - arid desert prone to extreme temperatures .
