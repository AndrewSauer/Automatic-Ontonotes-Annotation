Raetia was the name of a canton of the Helvetic Republic from 1798 to 1803 , corresponding to modern Graubünden and composed of the Free State of the Three Leagues . 

Until 1799 , the canton was administered by the central government of the Helvetic Republic . 

The districts of Chiavenna , Valtellina and Bormio , previously dependencies of the Leagues , were never a part of the canton , having permanently been detached from the Leagues after Revolutionary France fomented revolt there , leading them to be annexed to the Cisalpine Republic on October 10 , 1797 . 

The districts subsequently joined the Austrian client kingdom of Lombardy - Venetia after the Congress of Vienna and eventually become the Italian province of Sondrio . 

The town of Campione , an imperial fief into the Landvogtei of Lugano at the same time , joined Lombardy leading to its current position as an Italian enclave within Ticino . 

With the Napoleonic Act of Mediation in 1803 , the canton was reestablished as Graubünden , finally incorporating the Three Leagues into a decentralized and federal Switzerland .
