Yūsuf ibn Yaʿqūb ibn Is - ḥāq ibn Ibrāhīm ( ) is a Nabi ( , Prophet ) mentioned in the Qurʾān , the scripture of Islam , and corresponds to Joseph ( son of Jacob ) , a person from the Tanakh , the Jewish religious scripture , and the Christian Bible , who was estimated to have lived in the 16th century BCE . 

It is one of the common names in the Middle East and among Muslim nations . 

Of all of Jacob 's children , Joseph was the one given the gift of prophecy . 

Although the narratives of other prophets are mentioned in various Surahs , the complete narrative of Joseph is given only in one Surah , Yusuf , making it unique . 

It is said to be the most detailed narrative in the Qur'an and bears more details than the Biblical counterpart . 

Yusuf is believed to have been the eleventh son of Yaʿqūb ( , Jacob ) , and , according to many scholars , his favorite . 

According to Ibn Kathir , " Jacob had twelve sons who were the eponymous ancestors of the tribes of the Israelites . 

The noblest , the most exalted , the greatest of them was Joseph . " 

The story begins with Joseph revealing a ru'ya ( , ' dream ' or ' vision ' ) to his father , which Jacob recognizes . 

In addition to the role of God in his life , the story of Yusuf and Zulaikha ( Potiphar 's wife of the Old Testament ) became a popular subject in Persian literature , where it became considerably elaborated over the centuries . 

More recently , and relying on the Quran and Muslim , Christian and Jewish scholarly sources , Yusuf 's story has been depicted in a 45-part TV series ( originally in Persian but also dubbed in multiple other languages ) .
