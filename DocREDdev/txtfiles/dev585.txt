Henri Guédon ( born May 22 , 1944 in Fort de France in Martinique - died on February 12 , 2006 in Paris , France after heart surgery ) was a French percussionist from Martinique . 

His first band was called La Contesta and he organised it when he was 20 . 

He was awarded a Maracas d'or the first year the awards ran . 

In 1983 , Philippe Langlais invited him to compose a mix of classical and jazz with his orchestra , the resulting composition called Opéra Triangulaire . 

He was a judo champion 1963 - 65 . 

Multiple albums fused Antillean rhythms with other music from around the world . 

Guedon was instrumental in exporting the new sound of 60s and 70s Latin -guaguanco , boogaloo , salsa , descarga - to France and the rest of Europe . 

When Guedon began placing his percussion instruments at the front of the stage in the style of his great influence Ray Barretto , French audience members found themselves shocked and intrigued . 

Soon enough , greats like El Conde and Pacheco were touring France . 

Were it not for Henri Guedon , Europe could have conceivably taken years to move forward from mambo and cha - cha - cha .
