María de Buenos Aires is a tango operetta ( tango operita ) with music by Ástor Piazzolla and libretto by Horacio Ferrer that premiered at the Sala Planeta in Buenos Aires on 8 May 1968 . 

The first part of the surreal plot centers on the experiences of a prostitute in Buenos Aires , Argentina ; the second part takes place after her death . 

The characters include María ( and , after her death , the Shadow of María ) , a singer of payadas ; various members of the Buenos Aires underworld ; a payador who functions as a poet and narrator ; a goblin - like duende ; several marionettes under the control of the duende ; a circus of psychoanalysts ; pasta makers ; and construction workers . 

Many elements of the libretto suggest parallels between María and Mary , the mother of Jesus ( in Spanish , María ) or Jesus himself . 

While certainly not in the narrow sense an opera ballet , because the dance is tango rather than classical ballet , it falls within the tradition of having set dance pieces integral to an operatic work . 

The music draws on the nuevo tango idiom for which Piazzolla is famous . 

The original idea for the story was conceived by Piazzolla 's lover at the time of its composition , Egle Martin , who was married to Eduardo " Lalo " Palacios . 

The title role was originally conceived for Martin , but while Piazzolla was still composing the operita , he and Martin broke up after he asked her husband for her hand at Christmas in 1967 . 

According to Martin , Piazzolla said to Lalo , " She is music , she ca n't belong to anybody , no she is music , she is music , and that 's me . " 

After their rift , a replacement was desperately needed , but Piazzolla soon met folksinger Amelita Baltar at the Buenos Aires nightclub Nuestro Tiempo , formerly known as " 676 " and once Piazzolla 's home base in Argentina . 

Baltar 's identification with the character María , paired with her beauty and captivating stage presence , made her ideal for the role . 

The piece is written for at least three vocalists ( one of whom , the narrator , mainly speaks rather sings ) . 

For the orchestration Piazzolla augmented his current working quintet : Piazzolla ( bandoneón ) , Antonio Agri ( violin ) , Jamie " El Russo " Gosis ( piano ) , Oscar Lopez Ruiz ( guitar ) and Kicho Díaz ( double bass ) ; with viola , cello , flute , percussion , vibraphone and xylophone , and a second guitar . 

María de Buenos Aires has often been performed with dancers as well as musicians . 

There are several extant arrangements , including Piazzolla 's own and one by Pablo Ziegler .
