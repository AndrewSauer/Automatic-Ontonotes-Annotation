The Fortunate Pilgrim is a 1965 novel by Mario Puzo . 

Until his dying day , Mario Puzo considered the novel his finest , most poetic , and literary work . 

In one of his last interviews he stated that he was saddened by the fact that The Godfather , a fiction he never liked , outshone the novel of his mother 's honest immigrant struggle for respectability in America and her courage and filial love , as portrayed in The Fortunate Pilgrim , 1965 . 

The Fortunate Pilgrim is the real birthplace of The Godfather . 

As Puzo says , the book 's hero , Lucia Santa , is based on his own mother : " Whenever the Godfather opened his mouth , in my own mind I heard the voice of my mother . 

I heard her wisdom , her ruthlessness , and her unconquerable love for her family and for life itself . 

… The Don 's courage and loyalty came from her ; his humanity came from her … and so , I know now , without Lucia Santa , I could not have written The Godfather . "
