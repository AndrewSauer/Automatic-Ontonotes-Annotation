Lavaca Bay ( ) is a northwestern extension of the Matagorda Bay system found mostly in Calhoun County , Texas , United States . 

The ports of Port Lavaca and Point Comfort have been established on the bay , and are the main areas of human habitation . 

Linnville was located on the bay until its abandonment after the Great Raid of 1840 , and the major port of Indianola was found near the confluence with the main Matagorda Bay , until the town 's final destruction following the massive hurricane of 1886 . 

Smaller communities include Olivia , Alamo Beach and Magnolia Beach . 

Lavaca Bay is approximately northeast of Corpus Christi , about southwest of Houston , and southeast of San Antonio . 

The bay is noted for its superfund site , caused by mercury pollution from the heavy industry in Point Comfort ( specifically Alcoa ) , across the bay from the largest settlement of Port Lavaca . 

Although fishing has declined in recent years due to fears of contamination , the bay supports a large finfish population , and the efforts of environmental organizations and the federal government have pressured Alcoa to reduce the polluted areas .
