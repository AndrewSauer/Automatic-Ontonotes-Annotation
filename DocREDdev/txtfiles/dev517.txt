Calueque is a town next to a dam and pumping station of the same name on the Kunene River in the Kunene Province of southern Angola . 

The water project is linked to Ruacana , away in Namibia , where the Ruacana Power Station is . 

This dam is one of the last landmarks along the Kunene River , prior to the Kunene becoming a border feature between Angola and Namibia . 

A pipeline and canal extends across the border into Namibia , supplying towns as far away as Oshakati in Ovamboland with water . 

The dam was completed in 1976 . 

However , due to the onset of the Angolan civil war following independence , the full master plan for the scheme was not realised by the South African and Portuguese governments .
