Washington v. Texas , 388 U.S. 14 ( 1967 ) , is a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court decided that the Compulsory Process Clause of the Sixth Amendment to the Constitution ( guaranteeing the right of a criminal defendant to force the attendance of witnesses for their side ) is applicable in state courts as well as federal courts . 

Jackie Washington had attempted to call his co - defendant as a witness , but was blocked by Texas courts because state law prevented co - defendants from testifying for each other , under the theory that they would be likely to lie for each other on the stand . 

The Supreme Court reasoned that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment made the right to be able to compel defense witnesses to testify necessary for a defendant 's " due process " rights to fair proceedings , which applies to the states . 

Only Justice John Marshall Harlan II parted from the Court 's " due process " focus , though he agreed with the outcome , as he regularly did in cases involving whether to apply federal rights to state courts . 

The impact of Washington was narrowed by a later case , Taylor v. Illinois ( 1988 ) , in which the Court said that " countervailing public interests " , like the need to move through cases quickly , could be balanced against a defendant 's right to present witnesses . 

In Taylor , the Supreme Court upheld a judge 's order blocking defense witnesses from testifying due to the defense attorney 's deliberate failure to disclose evidence to prosecutors earlier in the trial . 

The defense attorney 's actions resulted in a lengthy delay in the proceedings which the trial judge felt was unjustified . 

Legal scholars have seen this new grant of discretion to trial judges as a change to relying on " efficient justice " , a more limited vision of trial rights than the " right to present a defense " created in Washington .
