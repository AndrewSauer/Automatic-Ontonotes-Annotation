Peters Club was an Australian children 's television series which reportedly debuted in 1958 , and aired on GTV-9 , running into 1959 . 

At the time , many Australian TV series were only broadcast on a single station instead of being networked , which may have also been the case with the series . 

Cast included Rod McLennan , Judy Banks and Joff Ellen . 

There is very little information available on this show but it is known that the now - defunct Truth newspaper gave it an award for " Best Children 's Show - Melbourne Television " . 

Notably , it was produced by Crawford Productions . 

The title is possibly in reference to the sponsor . 

As was also the case with 1950s American television series , early Australian television series sometimes featured the name of the sponsor in the title . 

Other examples included The Dulux Show , Tarax Show , Shell Presents , Swallows Parade , The Astor Show , among others . 

There is no information available as to whether any episodes exist as kinescope recordings , the method used to record live television in Australia prior to the introduction of video - tape , as many live broadcasts of the era were not recorded .
