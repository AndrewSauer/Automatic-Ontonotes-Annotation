The East Asia Economic Caucus ( EAEC ) or East Asia Economic Group ( EAEG ) was a regional free trade zone ( FTA ) proposed in 1997 by Malaysian Prime Minister Dr. Mahathir bin Mohamad and encompasses the Association of Southeast Asian Nations ( ASEAN ) member states , China , Japan , and the Republic of Korea . 

Japan though refused participation due to the exclusion of the Western nations , which were already members of APEC and many other notable regional organizations in East Asia . 

The EAEC was a reaction to ASEAN 's integration into the Asia - Pacific Economic Cooperation ( APEC ) by Dr. Mahathir , who is known for his strong Asian standpoint . 

His suggestion apparently articulated his dissatisfaction with ASEAN joining APEC , which includes Western nations , an idea he was strongly opposed to . 

Therefore , EAEC was basically an APEC without North America and Australia . 

Nevertheless , it was never put into action officially . 

Recently the ASEAN+3 rounds might be called the successor of EAEC , which prompted Malaysia to state that EAEC was a reality . 

In 2005 , due to Japan 's support of the agreement , ASEAN Plus Three(ASEAN+3 or APT)agreed to include Australia , New Zealand , and India during the East Asia Summit .
