Penedo da Saudade is the name of an historical public garden in Coimbra , Portugal . 

The garden have partial views of Coimbra skyline and the Coimbra City Stadium . 

According to the legend , nothing remained the same after the death of Inês de Castro . 

It used to be a relaxing and isolated place , where D. Pedro used to come to grieve the loss of his beloved Inês . 

It is said that this mourning and sadness gave this place its name – Penedo da Saudade ( Rock of Nostalgia ) . 

Many centuries later , it seemed to be the right place for the romantic encounters of students , and it was at this time that Coimbra Fado was born , challenging eternity with words they etched on the stone . 

These words represent the feelings of many generations of Coimbra students and lovers which can be seen today in the rocks of the garden .
