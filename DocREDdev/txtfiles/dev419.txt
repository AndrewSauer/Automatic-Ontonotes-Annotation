Ire Works is the third studio album by American mathcore band The Dillinger Escape Plan . 

The album was released on November 5 , 2007 in the United Kingdom and on November 13 , 2007 through Relapse Records in the US ; their last album on the label . 

The album is Gil Sharone 's first and last album with the band and their first without founding drummer Chris Pennie . 

Lead guitarist Ben Weinman plays guitar alone on the record , due to Brian Benoit 's injury . 

The album incorporates influences from electronic music . 

According to an interview in Terrorizer magazine , this is their last album on the Relapse Records label . 

The album was critically successful , debuting on the Billboard 200 at number 142 with 7,000 copies scanned , but was later corrected when it was revealed that Relapse somehow forgot to scan the pre - release album sales , which made the first week total actually around 11,000 . 

The album features guest vocals by band 's former vocalist Dimitri Minakakis ( on " Fix Your Face " ) and Mastodon 's Brent Hinds ( on " Horse Hunter " ) .
