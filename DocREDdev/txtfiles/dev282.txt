Electoral district of Frankston East was an electoral district of the Legislative Assembly in the Australian state of Victoria . 

It was created in 1992 , mostly out of the old Frankston North . 

The seat is notable for having decided the 1999 state election , which proved to be the last election in which it was contested . 

The incumbent , Liberal - turned - independent Peter McLellan , died on election day , forcing a supplementary election a month later . 

Neither the Coalition nor Labor had won a majority , placing the balance of power in the hands of three independents . 

They deferred their decision until the supplementary election . 

In the 16 October supplementary election , Labor candidate Matt Viney won on a swing of 7.7 percent , resulting in a hung parliament . 

The independents then announced their support for Labor , making Labor leader Steve Bracks premier .
