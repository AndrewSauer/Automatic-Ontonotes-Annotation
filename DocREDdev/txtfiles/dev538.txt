Léon la lune ( ) is a 1956 French short documentary film directed by Alain Jessua . 

The film won the Prix Jean Vigo in 1957 . 

The film documents an old drifter in Paris in the poetic realist style . 

Jessua was inspired by Jean - Paul Clébert 's book Paris Insolite ( 1952 ) and decided to make a film about a clochard or tramp . 

The poet and novelist Robert Giraud , an expert on the Parisian underworld , introduced Jessua to Léon la Lune , a vagrant whose real name was Leon Boudeville , and suggested that they follow him from day to night . 

After completing the film Giraud showed it to the poet and screenwriter Jacques Prévert who wrote an introduction and asked Henri Crolla to contribute some music to the film . 

Léon la lune also appeared in the series Clochards by Robert Doisneau , the pioneer of humanist photojournalism .
