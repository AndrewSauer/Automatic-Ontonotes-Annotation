" Amambanda " was the Dutch entry in the Eurovision Song Contest 2006 , performed predominantly in an imaginary language but with some words in English by Treble . 

This was the second occasion on which a song had been performed with lyrics in an invented language - Belgium having entered Sanomi by Urban Trad at the 2003 Contest . 

The song is an up - tempo number , with many influences from African and flamenco music . 

The lyrics explain that " There is a way / To understand without a language " , in keeping with the musical theme of exuberant joy in spite of an apparently insurmountable language barrier . 

The title was the cause of much confusion prior to the Contest , with the official CD of entries titling the track " Amanbanda " ( with an " n " instead of an " m " ) . 

BBC commentary referred to the song as " Amamdangda " briefly , as well as describing the group as " a mother and her two daughters " , which was also incorrect as Caroline Hoffman was not the mother of the two van Dijk sisters , though this comment was sarcastic and not taken as literal by listeners . 

As the Netherlands had not finished the 2005 Contest in the top 10 , the song was performed in the semi - final . 

Here , it was performed seventeenth , following Finland 's Lordi with " Hard Rock Hallelujah " and preceding Lithuania 's LT United with " We Are The Winners " . 

At the close of voting , it had received 22 points , placing 20th in a field of 23 and thus missing out on the final and requiring the Netherlands to qualify from the semi - final at the next Contest . 

Immediately following this result , rumours began to circulate that the Netherlands would opt out of the next Contest . 

These rumours were , however , proven to be untrue as the country began qualification for the 2007 Contest . 

It was succeeded as Dutch representative at the 2007 Contest by Edsilia Rombley with " On Top of the World " .
