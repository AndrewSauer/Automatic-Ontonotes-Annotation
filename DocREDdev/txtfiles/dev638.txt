Zarir ( also spelled Zarih ) was a Sasanian prince who was the leader of a rebellion in northern Iran in 485 . 

According to Armenian historian Ghazar Parpetsi , who is the only source about the life of Zarir , the latter was a son of the Sasanian shah Yazdegerd II . 

He had several brothers named Balash , Hormizd III , and Peroz I. 

After the death of Peroz I ( who had succeeded his father as king ) , Balash was elected as king by the nobility and clergy . 

Zarir , dissatisfied with the election , rebelled . 

Balash was thus forced to make peace with his enemy Vahan Mamikonian and sent him at the head of an army to suppress the rebellion of Zarir . 

Zarir was shortly defeated , and fled to the mountains , but was quickly captured and " shot down like an animal " .
