" Ramblin ' on My Mind " is a blues song recorded on November 23 , 1936 in San Antonio , Texas by blues musician Robert Johnson . 

The song was originally released on 78 rpm format as Vocalion 03519 and ARC 7 - 05 - 81 . 

Johnson performed the song in the key of E , and recorded two takes . 

Both takes were used for different pressings of both the Vocalion issue and the ARC issue . 

The song used the melody made popular by the hit record " M & O Blues " by Walter Davis . 

Johnson composed two songs to this melody , " Ramblin ' on My Mind " and " When You Got a Good Friend " , with different musical approaches and different guitar tunings , although both were in the key of E. For " Ramblin ' on My Mind " he used an open tuning that allowed him to combine a boogie shuffle on the bass strings with bottleneck triplets on the treble strings . 

These slide triplets were the model for Elmore James 's guitar accompaniment to " Dust My Broom " . 

The song was recorded by John Mayall & the Bluesbreakers with Eric Clapton on lead vocals and featured on the album Blues Breakers with Eric Clapton ( 1966 ) , and by Clapton on the albums Just One Night , , Sessions for Robert J , and on Live from Madison Square Garden . 

Lucinda Williams also recorded it for her first professional release , Ramblin ' ( 1979 ) .
