The first official National Football League ( NFL ) playoff game was the 1933 NFL Championship Game between the Chicago Bears and New York Giants . 

A " playoff " game was played in 1932 between the Chicago Bears and Portsmouth Spartans to break a regular season tie , but is recorded in the team record books as a regular season game . 

Since then there have been a total over 525 NFL playoff games including games from the AFL , but not the AAFC . 

The following list shows career postseason records for each starting quarterback in the NFL playoffs . 

Wins or losses are credited to the quarterback who started the game for each team , even if he was injured or failed to complete the game . 

While many players have won playoff games for two teams , only two have won a championship for different franchises . 

Tobin Rote was quarterback for the NFL champion 1957 Lions and the AFL champion 1963 Chargers . 

Peyton Manning was the quarterback for 2006 Colts and the 2015 Broncos . 

Note : from 1933â€“1949 some offenses did not employ a quarterback in the modern sense of the position . 

Listed below are the " primary passers " for those games , the players that passed the ball most in those games . 

They may not have actually started the game at quarterback . 

This format allows Hall of Fame quarterbacks like Sid Luckman and Sammy Baugh to maintain credit for their team 's playoff records since they were obviously the top passer for their team . 

The players involved in such games are marked with an asterisk ( * ) .
