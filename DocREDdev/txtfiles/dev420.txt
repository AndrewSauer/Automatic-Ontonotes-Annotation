" All Together Now " is a song by Liverpudlian band The Farm from their album Spartacus , and links some of the band 's favourite themes : socialism , brotherhood and football . 

Peter Hooton wrote the lyrics in his early 20s after reading about the Christmas truce of 1914 . 

The song was first recorded under the title " No Man 's Land " for a John Peel session in 1983 . 

In 1990 , Hooton wrote the chorus after Steve Grimes suggested putting the lyrics of No Man 's Land to the chord progression of Pachelbel 's Canon . 

To shorten the song for radio , the producer Suggs cut the song to three verses from its original six . 

It has been used by numerous football teams since , as well as by the Labour Party ( UK ) for their 2017 General Election campaign , often played during rallies .
