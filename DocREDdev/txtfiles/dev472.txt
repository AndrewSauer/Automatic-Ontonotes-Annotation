Schizoanalysis (; schizo- from Greek σχίζειν skhizein , meaning " to split " ) is a concept created by philosopher Gilles Deleuze and psychoanalyst Félix Guattari and first expounded in their book Anti - Oedipus ( 1972 ) . 

Its formulation was continued in their follow - up work , A Thousand Plateaus . 

Schizoanalysis acquires many different definitions during the course of its development in their collaborative work and individually in the work of Guattari . 

In Chaosmosis , Guattari explains that " rather than moving in the direction of reductionist modifications which simplify the complex " , schizoanalysis " will work towards its complexification , its processual enrichment , towards the consistency of its virtual lines of bifurcation and differentiation , in short towards its ontological heterogeneity " .
