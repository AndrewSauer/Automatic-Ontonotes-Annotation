The Berlin - Hohenschönhausen Memorial ( ) is a museum and memorial located in Berlin 's north - eastern Lichtenberg district in the locality of Alt - Hohenschönhausen , part of the former borough of Hohenschönhausen . 

It was opened in 1994 on the site of the main political prison of the former East German Communist Ministry of State Security , the Stasi . 

Unlike many other government and military institutions in East Germany , Hohenschönhausen prison was not stormed by demonstrators after the fall of the Berlin Wall , allowing prison authorities to destroy evidence of the prison 's functions and history . 

Because of this , today 's knowledge of the functioning of the prison comes mainly from eye - witness accounts and documents sourced from other East German institutions . 

The prison was depicted in the 2006 film The Lives of Others , and in 2017 TV series The Same Sky . 

It is a member organisation of the Platform of European Memory and Conscience .
