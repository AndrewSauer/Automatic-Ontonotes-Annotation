The Boulevard des Capucines is one of the four ' grands boulevards ' in Paris , a chain of boulevards running east - west that also includes Boulevard de la Madeleine , Boulevard des Italiens , and Boulevard Montmartre . 

The name comes from a beautiful convent of Capuchin nuns whose garden was on the south side of the boulevard prior to the French Revolution . 

The former name , Rue Basse - du - Rempart ( " bottom - of - the - wall street " in French ) , suggests that , in the beginning , the street paralleled the city wall of Paris . 

Then , when the wall was destroyed , the street was widened and became a boulevard . 

Piet Mondrian 's little known story De groote boulevards ( Les Grands Boulevards ) , written in 1920 in Paris at the instance of Theo van Doesburg , was inspired by the Boulevard des Capucines .
