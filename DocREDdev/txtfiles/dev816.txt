Microsoft Sync Framework is a data synchronization platform from Microsoft that can be used to synchronize data across multiple data stores . 

Sync Framework includes a transport - agnostic architecture , into which data store - specific synchronization providers , modelled on the ADO.NET data provider API , can be plugged in . 

Sync Framework can be used for offline access to data , by working against a cached set of data and submitting the changes to a master database in a batch , as well as to synchronize changes to a data source across all consumers ( publish / subscribe sync ) and peer - to - peer synchronization of multiple data sources . 

Sync Framework features built - in capabilities for conflict detection – whether data to be changed has already been updated – and can flag them for manual inspection or use defined policies to try to resolve the conflict . 

Sync Services includes an embedded SQL Server Compact database to store metadata about the synchronization relationships as well as about each sync attempt . 

The Sync Framework API is surfaced both in managed code , for use with .NET Framework applications , as well as unmanaged code , for use with COM applications . 

It was scheduled to ship with Visual Studio 2008 in late November 2007 .
