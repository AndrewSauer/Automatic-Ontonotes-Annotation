My Red Hot Car is notable for two different hidden tracks , based on format : the CD version features an ambient piece after 23 minutes of silence , while the vinyl features a percussion - less version of " I Wish You Obelisk " presented behind a silent , locked groove , meaning the needle must be lifted halfway through the second side and placed after the locked groove in order to hear it .
