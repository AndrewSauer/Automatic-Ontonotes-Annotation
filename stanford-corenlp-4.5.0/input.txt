Over a distant , barren planet , a solitary silver sphere floated endlessly . It had slept for millions of years , waiting for a specific signal from the hordes of nanomachines beneath . But nothing of note had come . Not until today .

Lightning had struck the surface of the dark waters of the planet 's largest ocean . This was hardly noteworthy on its own , but this planet was designated high - risk due to the unique chemical compositions found within its waters . The nanobots had investigated promptly and thouroughly , and had found a disturbing pattern in one area of the water .

As the data from this observation reached the sphere , it woke from its slumber . As it analyzed the pattern within , looking for the telltale signs of the old horror it was built to prevent , dark images flowed through its head . Entities of all kinds being slashed apart , stabbed , poisoned , burned , or eaten alive . Horrible screams and smells . Human sacrifices being skinned alive or left to be eaten by bugs from the inside out . Children beaten and forced into sexual slavery , or sliced out of their mother 's womb and eaten , or fed to beasts . Men screaming as they died in gas , heads being crushed under the treads of tanks . Entire cities , stricken with cancer and covered in horrid burns .

As the sphere concluded its study of the dark pattern it had found , there was only one conclusion it could reach , and that was that it must fulfil its purpose . " Never again . " The words burned across its mind as it sent out the command . Half of the planet was consumed in fire as the nanomachines below detonated . All traces of the abhorrent pattern would be vaporized . The sphere reported the incident to central command , asked for energy to replenish its lost nanobots , and then slept once again .
