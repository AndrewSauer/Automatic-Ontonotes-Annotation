Repository for OSU Honors Thesis: https://ir.library.oregonstate.edu/concern/honors_college_theses/n583z312g

This repository is unfinished. The code will not work until I track down all the dependancies and fix some ad-hoc filesystem stuff. I'll need to get this working on another system and fix some stuff before I can call this stable.

Also, much of the code, particularly in the folders consec-main, mrc-srl, stanford-corenlp-4.5.0, and ETC/etcmodel, is not my own, but copied from other repositories.
