Although the genealogy of early Ponthieu and Boulogne is scanty ( and the 12th century versions unreliable , because of their efforts to tie the ruling houses of Boulogne and Ponthieu into earlier noble houses ) , it is most likely that Guy , the Bishop of Amiens , was the uncle ( and not the brother ) of Enguerrand II and his brother Guy I of Ponthieu .
