Plain sentence:

Though this ballad never comments explicitly on William and Mary 's 1689 penning of the English Bill of Rights , it nevertheless focuses heavily on one specific component of the act , namely the reestablishment of Protestant liberty , as William III and Mary II were both Protestants : " For a Protestant King and a Protestant Queen , / The like in old England long time hath not been . "
