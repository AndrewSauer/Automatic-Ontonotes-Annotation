Plain sentence:
---------------
However , this was not always the case ; in the 1917 Code of Canon Law , Canon 761 required pastors to ensure the baptismal name was a Christian name such as " Christian , " " Grace " or " Faith " - hence what is now called a given name was once referred to as a Christian name , originating with the pagans of Europe who discarded their pagan names for Biblical ones when they converted to Christianity and participated in baptism - or that an additional saint 's name must be given when the former is impossible .
