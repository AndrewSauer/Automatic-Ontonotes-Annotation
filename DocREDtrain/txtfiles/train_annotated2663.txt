Catoosa Wildlife Management Area is a large game - management area on the Upper Cumberland Plateau in Morgan , Cumberland and Fentress counties in Tennessee in the United States . 

It comprises 82,000 acres ( 332 Â  km ) of wild land administered by the Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency ( TWRA ) . 

The Management Area is funded by hunters and fishermen , and is popular with all outdoors enthusiasts , including backpackers , and whitewater rafters . 

It has many trails for hiking , of which the most notable is the Cumberland Trail . 

It also has gravel roads and dirt track four - wheel drive roads for motorized exploration . 

Catoosa ranges from gentle rolling hills to some of the most rugged and extreme terrain in the country . 

Many rivers and streams have cut deep canyons into the Cumberland Plateau and Cumberland Mountains of the Management area allowing for beautiful vistas . 

Catoosa and several other WMAs are closed to entry between sunset and sunrise in order to reduce the effect of the activities that are considered incompatible to established wildlife management practices . 

Because WMAs were purchased with funds generated by hunters , the TWRA regards hunting as the main priority on these areas . 

Off - road vehicles and horses are permitted , but only on certain roads and trails . 

Overnight camping is allowed on designated areas by permission of the area manager .
