Solid Rock is a 1972 album by The Temptations for the Gordy ( Motown ) label , produced by Norman Whitfield . 

The LP was the first made primarily without founding members and original lead singers Eddie Kendricks and Paul Williams . 

Frustrated by conflicts and fights with Temptations Otis Williams and Melvin Franklin , and producer Whitfield 's steadfast insistence on producing psychedelic soul for the group when they really wanted to sing ballads , Kendricks had quit the act and negotiated a solo deal with Motown 's Tamla label . 

Paul Williams , on the other hand , had fallen ill due to complications from sickle - cell disease and six years of untreated alcoholism . 

Physically incapable of performing any longer , Williams followed his doctor 's advice and retired from the act , although he remained on the Temptations ' payroll as a choreographer until committing suicide on August 17 , 1973 . 

Williams 's final Temptations recording , " It 's Summer " , is the only song on Solid Rock that includes his vocals .
