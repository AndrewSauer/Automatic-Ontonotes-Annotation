Marguerite ( Margot ) Ruddock ( 1907 â€“ 1951 ) , who used the stage name Margot Collis , was an English actress , poet and singer . 

She had a relationship with W. B. Yeats starting in 1934 . 

Their correspondence was published as Ah , Sweet Dancer ( 1970 ) . 

Yeats edited her poems for publication , but it is not clear how much change he made to them . 

He included some of them in the Oxford Book of Modern Verse , which he edited . 

Some of her poems have been set as songs by the composer Robert Erickson . 

She was married twice : first to John Collis , with whom she had a son , Michael , and secondly to Raymond Lovell , with whom she had a daughter , Simone Lovell . 

She died in 1951 , when she was 44 . 

During her marriage to Raymond Lovell she had an affair with Yeats . 

When they met in 1934 , Yeats was 69 and Margot was 27 . 

Their affair was conducted fitfully over the next few years - it 's not clear whether there was an actual physical act involved . 

The affair broke down and Margot Ruddock became mentally unstable . 

Some months later she followed Yeats ( uninvited ) out to the island of Majorca , where he was working with the Indian monk Shri Purohit Swami . 

Margot ended up in an asylum in Madrid from where she had to be sprung by Yeats and his friends . 

Yeats ' poem " A Crazed Girl " is believed to be inspired by Margot .
