The Hanau - Gelnhausen high - speed railway is a planned railway connecting Hanau and Gelnhausen in Germany . 

It would start from local tracks in Hanau and connect with the Hanover – Würzburg high - speed railway at Gelnhausen . 

The railway would improve journey times for trains travelling from Frankfurt - am - Main to both Berlin and Munich . 

Trains travelling to Berlin would be able to reach the Hanover – Würzburg high - speed railway quickly and trains travelling to Munich would , if the connection includes a triangular junction , allow high - speed trains to bypass Aschaffenburg ( where high - speed trains stop on the way to Munich ) and reach Würzburg quicker . 

The federal transport minister told parliament in 2010 that construction would not commence prior to 2025 . 

Despite this the federal government has allocated funds to continue the planning process .
