The Catholic Church in the Gambia and Sierra Leone , two Anglophone ( ex - British ) West African countries , is composed solely of a Latin hierarchy , comprising : 

one ecclesiastical province , covering all and only Sierra Leone , comprising the Metropolitan of capital Freetown and three suffragan dioceses . 

an exempt diocese ( directly dependent on the Holy See ) for all the Gambia , with see in its capital Banjul . 

There are no Eastern Catholic or pre - diocesan jurisdictions or overlapping ordinariates . 

Neither country has a national Episcopal Conference , but they form a joint one for the Gambia and Sierra Leone , which hosts it in Freetown . 

There are no titular sees . 

All defunct jurisdictions are precursors of present sees . 

There formally is an Apostolic Nunciature ( embassy - level papal diplomatic representation ) to Sierra Leone and an Apostolic Nunciature to The Gambia , but both are vested in the Apostolic Nunciature to Liberia ( in its capital Monrovia ) .
