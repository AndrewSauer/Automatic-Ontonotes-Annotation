Mahmud Astrakhani ( Urdu;Persian;Arabic : ) was one of Küchük Muhammad 's sons and a Khan who founded the Khanate of Astrakhan in the 1460s . 

After years of struggle for the throne of the Great Horde against Akhmat Khan , he escaped to the town of Hajji Tarkhan ( or Xacitarxan ) , establishing the independent Khanate of Astrakhan there . 

Mahmud Astrakhani maintained friendly relations with his powerful neighbors - the Nogay Horde and the Great Horde and coined his own money . 

His letter to the Ottoman Sultan Mehmed II ( as dispatched on April 10 , 1466 ) is a curious example of diplomatic epistles written in the 15th - century Old Tatar language . 

The content is a necessity of renewal of diplomatic relations between Turkey and Astrakhan , and sending ambassadors to Istanbul . 

For uncertainties and additional information see the second part of List of Astrakhan khans . 

His son Janibeg briefly ruled Crimea in the winter of 1476/77 until he was driven out by the legitimate ruler Nur Devlet .
