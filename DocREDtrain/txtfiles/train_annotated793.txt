A megacity is a very large city , typically with a population in excess of 10 million people . 

Precise definitions vary : the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs in its 2014 " World Urbanization Prospects " report counted urban agglomerations having over 10 million inhabitants . 

A University of Bonn report held that they are " usually defined as metropolitan areas with a total population of 10 million or more people " . 

Others list cities satisfying criteria of either 5 or 8 million and also have a population density of 2,000 per square kilometre . 

A megacity can be a single metropolitan area or two or more metropolitan areas that converge . 

The terms conurbation , metropolis , and metroplex are also applied to the latter . 

The term metacity has been used to describe metropolitan conurbations containing over 20 million people . 

As of 2017 , there are 47 megacities in existence . 

Most of these urban agglomerations are in China and other countries of Asia . 

The largest are the metropolitan areas of Tokyo , Shanghai , and Jakarta , each having over 30 million inhabitants . 

China alone has 15 megacities , and India has six . 

Other countries with megacities include the United States , Brazil and Pakistan , each with two .
