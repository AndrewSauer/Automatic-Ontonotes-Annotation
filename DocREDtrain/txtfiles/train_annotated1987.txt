The Rocket Post is a 2004 British drama film directed by Stephen Whittaker and starring Ulrich Thomsen , Shauna Macdonald , Kevin McKidd and Patrick Malahide . 

It is set on a remote Scottish island during the late 1930s . 

The arrival of German rocket scientist Gerhard Zucker is not initially welcomed by the inhabitants of the island . 

The film was shot in 2001 , but its release was delayed by several years . 

Additional footage was shot in 2005 , and the film was given a limited release in Scotland the following year . 

The story is very loosely based on experiments in 1934 by the German inventor Gerhard Zucker to provide a postal service to the island of Scarp by rocket mail . 

Another fictionalised account of the experiment formed the basis of a 2001 film , also called The Rocket Post , which was filmed on Taransay . 

The film 's original score was composed by Nigel Clarke & Michael Csanyi - Wills and recorded by the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra in London .
