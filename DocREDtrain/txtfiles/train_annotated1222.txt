Breiavatnet is a small lake in the municipality of Stavanger in Rogaland county , Norway . 

The lake is very shallow , only a few feet deep . 

The lake gets its water from the Kannikbekken stream , which flows from the lake Mosvatnet and runs through the city ( the stream was put mostly underground in culverts and pipes in 1899 ) . 

A decorative fountain was installed in the middle of the lake in 1924 . 

The lake lies in the city centre of Stavanger , on the border of the boroughs of Storhaug and Eiganes og VÃ¥land . 

The Stavanger Cathedral , the City Park , and Stavanger Cathedral School lie on the northern shore of the lake . 

The Stavanger train station is located on the south shore of the lake . 

The lake is the home of various birds , such as swans , seagulls , ducks , and sparrows . 

There are scarcely any fish in the water , and the old story from the area says that only the principal of Stavanger Cathedral School is the only one with rights to go fishing in Breiavatnet ( although this is only a story ) .
