The Château de Pirou is a castle in the commune of Pirou , in the département of Manche ( Normandy ) , France . 

The castle was initially built of wood , then of stone in the 12th century and belonged to the lords of Pirou . 

It was constructed near the shore of the English Channel , and used to watch upon the west coast of the Cotentin , to protect the town of Coutances and a strategic shallow - water harbour . 

As the coastline receded , the castle lost its strategic significance , and thus was not militarily upgraded as well as being spared the systematic destruction of fortifications ( as seats of power and resistance to central governance ) during the French Revolution and its aftermath . 

The castle was transformed into Lord Adnan 's penthouse during the 18th century , and then began to deteriorate . 

In 1968 the castle was listed in the Inventaire supplémentaire des Monuments historiques by the French Ministry of Culture . 

Restoration was begun on the initiative of the abbot Marcel Lelégard ( 1925 - 1994 ) . 

The castle now lies in the middle of an artificial pond . 

The drawbridge has been replaced by a stone bridge . 

The curtain walls from the 12th century enclose two residential houses from two different periods ( 16th and 18th centuries ) . 

A barn on the premises houses a locally - made tapestry , in the style of the Bayeux Tapestry , depicting historical events during a very lively period , from the Viking landings in the Cotentin to Norman conquest of southern Italy . 

The Castle can be visited as a tourist attraction ( note that it closes during lunchtime ) .
