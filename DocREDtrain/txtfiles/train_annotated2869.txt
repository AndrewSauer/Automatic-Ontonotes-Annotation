ServusTV is a TV station based in Wals - Siezenheim in the Austrian state of Salzburg . 

Its current name is derived from a popular greeting common to many parts of Germanic and Central Europe . 

The station started as Salzburg TV in 1995 and was initially available only by cable in Salzburg . 

The TV station got media attention as it started terrestrial transmission on 25 October 2000 , which was illegal at that time in Austria . 

The transmission facility , located at Untersberg transmitter ( owned by Germany , but physically located in Austria ) , was confiscated by Austrian authorities after five days . 

As a protest , the owner of Salzburg TV entered a hunger strike for two weeks . 

As a response , terrestrial transmission of private TV stations was legalized in Austria , and transmission restarted in 2002 from the old transmission site on UHF channel 36 . 

The TV station was sold in 2004 to prevent its bankruptcy . 

In 2007 the shares went to Red Bull GmbH. 

The original owners sold their shares on the station soon after , and in 2009 the station was renamed to Servus TV . 

The station started terrestrial transmissions in Berlin in December 2011 and in Hamburg in June 2014 .
