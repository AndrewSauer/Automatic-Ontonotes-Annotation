Mompox or Mompós , officially Santa Cruz de Mompox , is a town and municipality in northern Colombia , in the Bolívar Department , which has preserved its colonial character . 

Mompox depends upon tourism , fishing and some commerce generated by the local cattle raising . 

It has about 30,000 inhabitants , and is adjacent to the municipalities of Pinillos and San Fernando . 

Simón Bolívar , liberator of much of Spanish South America , said " If to Caracas I owe my life , then to Mompox I owe my glory . "
