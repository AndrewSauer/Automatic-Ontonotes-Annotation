Louis Alexander Slotin ( 1 December 1910   – 30 May 1946 ) was a Canadian physicist and chemist who took part in the Manhattan Project . 

He was born and raised in the North End of Winnipeg , Manitoba . 

After earning both his Bachelor of Science and Master of Science degrees from the University of Manitoba , Slotin attended King 's College London , where he obtained his doctorate in physical chemistry in 1936 . 

Afterwards , he joined the University of Chicago as a research associate to help design a cyclotron . 

In 1942 , he was invited to participate in the Manhattan Project . 

As part of the Manhattan Project , Slotin performed experiments with uranium and plutonium cores to determine their critical mass values . 

After World War II , Slotin continued his research at Los Alamos National Laboratory . 

On May 21 , 1946 , Slotin accidentally began a fission reaction , which released a burst of hard radiation . 

Slotin was rushed to the hospital , and died nine days later on May 30 , the victim of the second criticality accident in history , following the death of Harry Daghlian , who had been exposed to radiation by the same core that killed Slotin . 

Slotin was hailed as a hero by the United States government for reacting quickly enough to prevent the deaths of his colleagues . 

However , some physicists argue that this was a preventable accident . 

The accident and its aftermath have been dramatized in several fictional and non - fiction accounts .
