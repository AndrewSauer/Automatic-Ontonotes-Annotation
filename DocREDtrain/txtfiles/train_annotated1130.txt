The Deutsche Verkehrsfliegerschule ( DVS ) , German Air Transport School , was a covert military - training organization operating as a flying school in Germany . 

It began during the Weimar Republic in Staaken , Berlin in 1925 and its head office was transferred in 1929 to Broitzem airfield near Braunschweig . 

The DVS was outwardly a flying school for commercial pilots , but in fact became a secret military arm training military aviators for the future Luftwaffe . 

This training facility grew in importance in the initial stages of Nazi Germany , while camouflaging as a harmless civilian organization ( Tarnorganisation ) , at the time of Germany 's rearmament in violation of the Versailles Treaty . 

On May 31 , 1945 , after Nazi Germany 's defeat in World War II , the American Military Government issued a special law outlawing the Nazi Party and all of its branches . 

Known as " Law number five " , this Denazification decree disbanded the Deutsche Verkehrsfliegschule and its facilities were taken over by the occupying forces . 

Some flying schools in Germany operatie under the same name in different locations in the country . 

All of them were established after the war .
