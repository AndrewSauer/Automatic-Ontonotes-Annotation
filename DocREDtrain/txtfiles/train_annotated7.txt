Us and Them is the fifth studio album by English band Godflesh . 

It was released through Earache Records on 17 May 1999 in Europe and on 8 June 1999 in North America . 

As with Godflesh 's 1997 remix album Love and Hate in Dub , Us and Them is influenced by breakbeats , drum and bass , oldschool jungle , trip hop and hip hop . 

Shortly after Us and Them 's release , Godflesh frontman Justin Broadrick admitted that he " hated " the album as it was the expression of an " identity crisis " . 

Years later , he revised his thoughts , saying that his hatred of Us and Them was " overstated " , and that his main issue in the album lies in its more " cringe - worthy moments . "
