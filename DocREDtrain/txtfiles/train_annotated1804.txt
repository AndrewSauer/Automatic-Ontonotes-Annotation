The Revolutionary Liberation Movement Tupaq Katari ( Spanish : Movimiento Revolucionario Túpac Katari de Liberación , MRTKL ) is a left - wing political party in Bolivia . 

In 1985 , Jenaro Flores Santos split from the Tupaj Katari Revolutionary Movement and founded the Revolutionary Liberation Movement Tupaq Katari . 

It took part in 1985 elections , running Jenaro Flores Santos . 

He polled 2.11 per cent of the vote . 

Within a year of its formation , divisions emerged within the MRTKL between Jenaro Flores Santos , on the one hand , and Víctor Hugo Cárdenas and Walter Reynaga Vásquez , the party 's two deputies of the National Congress , on the other . 

In a 1988 party congress , Jenaro Flores Santos walked out with some of his supporters and formed the Katarist United Liberation Front ( FULKA ) . 

Both parties lost support after the internal bickering became public . 

Jenaro Flores Santos 's exit still did not achieve unity in the MRTKL : neither Cárdenas nor Reynaga Vásquez would accept the second position in the new party hierarchy . 

Cárdenas eventually edged out his rival . 

The MRTKL took part in 1989 elections , running Víctor Hugo Cárdenas . 

He polled 1.6 per cent of the vote . 

Although the indigenous candidates attracted large crowds , they found that many campesinos already were committed to the Revolutionary Nationalist Movement , the Revolutionary Left Movement , or other parties that had a better chance of winning .
