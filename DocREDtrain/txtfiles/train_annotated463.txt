Use Your Illusion is a Guns N ' Roses compilation album drawing from the Use Your Illusion I and II albums . 

It was only released in the United States , and was primarily sold at Walmart and Kmart , two retail outlets that refused to stock the unedited Use Your Illusion I and II due to explicit lyrics . 

" Knockin ' on Heaven 's Door " appears in an edited version without Josh Richman 's speech , removed for unknown reasons . 

Therefore , the track length is reduced to 5:20 , instead of 5:36 from the version included on Use Your Illusion II . 

Richman 's speech was instead included in the Greatest Hits compilation album . 

The cover art of the album simply combines the color schemes from the covers of Use Your Illusion I and Use Your Illusion II , which were originally designed by Mark Kostabi . 

The image is a detail of the Raphael painting " The School of Athens " .
