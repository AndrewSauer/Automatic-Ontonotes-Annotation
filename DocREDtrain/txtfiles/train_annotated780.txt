England 's Happiness in the Crowning of William and Mary is an English broadside ballad composed in 1689 and takes as its primary focus the coronation of William III of England and Mary II of England . 

William III and Mary II 's coregency began in February 1689 when the Convention Parliament , summoned by William after his invasion of England in 1689 , offered him the crown . 

Though this ballad never comments explicitly on William and Mary 's 1689 penning of the English Bill of Rights , it nevertheless focuses heavily on one specific component of the act , namely the reestablishment of Protestant liberty , as William III and Mary II were both Protestants : " For a Protestant King and a Protestant Queen , / The like in old England long time hath not been .
