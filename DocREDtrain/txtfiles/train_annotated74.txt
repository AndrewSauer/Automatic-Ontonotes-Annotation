Pelantaro or Pelantarú (; from the Mapuche pelontraru or " Shining Caracara " ) was one of the vice toquis of Paillamachu , the toqui or military leader of the Mapuche people during the Mapuche uprising in 1598 . 

Pelantaro and his lieutenants Anganamon and Guaiquimilla were credited with the death of the second Spanish Governor of Chile , Martín García Óñez de Loyola , during the Battle of Curalaba on December 21 , 1598 . 

This disaster provoked a general rising of the Mapuche and the other indigenous people associated with them . 

They succeeded in destroying all of the Spanish settlements south of the Bio - bio River and some to the north of it ( Santa Cruz de Oñez and San Bartolomé de Chillán in 1599 ) . 

After this disaster , the following Governor , Alonso de Ribera , fixed a border and took the suggestions of the Jesuit Luis de Valdivia to fight a defensive war . 

At one point , Pelantaro had both the heads of Pedro de Valdivia and Martín Óñez de Loyola and used them as trophies and containers for chicha , a kind of alcohol . 

As a demonstration of peaceful intentions , he gave them up in 1608 . 

Pelantaro was captured in 1616 and held for a year and a half until after the death of the governor Alonso de Ribera . 

He was released by his successor Fernando Talaverano Gallegos in a vain attempt to establish a peace with the Mapuche .
