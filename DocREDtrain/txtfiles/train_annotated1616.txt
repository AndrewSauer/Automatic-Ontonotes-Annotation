The Iglesia de Santo Tomé is a church located in the historical center of the city of Toledo ( Spain ) , and was founded after the reconquest of this city by King Alfonso VI of León . 

It appears quoted in the 12th century , as constructed on the site of an old mosque of the 11th century . 

This mosque , together with other mosques in the city , were used as Christian churches without major changes , since in the taking of the city there was no destruction of buildings . 

However , at the beginning of the 14th century , being in a ruinous state was totally rebuilt in charge of Gonzalo Ruiz de Toledo , Lord of Orgaz and the old minaret of the mosque was transformed into a bell tower in Mudéjar style . 

Its fame is mainly due to the fact that it contains the painting The Burial of the Count of Orgaz by El Greco , which can be seen by accessing the back of church .
