The Zilch memo was an American government document sent by National Security Advisor Henry Kissinger to President Richard Nixon on January 3 , 1972 , about the military situation in Laos during the Vietnam War . 

On the memo , in his own handwriting , Nixon described the decade - long bombing campaign by the United States in Southeast Asia as a " failure , " having achieved " zilch , " despite public comments to the contrary . 

Just the day before , January 2 , Nixon told CBS News reporter Dan Rather in an interview that the bombing was " very , very effective . " 

Previously missing from the Richard Nixon Library , the memo was discovered in the possession of Alexander Butterfield , who served as the Deputy Assistant to President Nixon from 1969 to 1973 , by Washington Post reporter Bob Woodward , who subsequently published it in his 2015 book The Last of the President 's Men . 

Despite Nixon 's private assessment that the bombing was a " failure , " U.S. bombing in Southeast Asia increased in 1972 .
