Karlheinz Martin ( May 6 , 1886 â€“ January 13 , 1948 ) was a German stage and film director , best known for his expressionist productions . 

After enjoying success with experimental productions in Frankfurt am Main and Hamburg , Martin went to Berlin , where he premiered Ernst Toller 's anti - war drama , Transfiguration ( Die Wandlung ) on September 30 , 1919 . 

Performed in a hall seating fewer than 300 spectators , the production used the intimacy of the space to drive home the horrors of Toller 's script . 

The sets were jagged flats placed against blackness , and lit with harsh white spotlights . 

Scenes ended in blackouts not , as was customary at the time , with the curtain falling . 

Fritz Kortner became famous for his intense portrayal of the young hero . 

Martin turned to film in 1920 , when he directed a cinematic adaptation of one of the most celebrated expressionist dramas , Georg Kaiser 's From Morn to Midnight ( Von morgens bis mitternachts ) with actor Ernst Deutsch as the Cashier who embezzles money from a bank and goes on a desperate search for meaning in his life in a nightmarish metropolis . 

After World War II , Martin revived Bertolt Brecht 's The Threepenny Opera in Berlin , and 

premiered Georg Kaiser 's pacifist drama , The Soldier Tanaka ( Der Soldat Tanaka ) .
