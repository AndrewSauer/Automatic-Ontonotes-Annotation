Dave Foster is an American musician who was the third drummer for the grunge rock band Nirvana . 

He was fired after playing only a couple of performances with the band , mostly because of his inability to attend rehearsal sessions regularly . 

Foster lived hours away from Kurt Cobain and bassist Krist Novoselic back in Aberdeen , Washington , which required the men to pick Foster up and bring him to the band 's rehearsal space in Tacoma . 

Based on Cobain 's own account , this made band practices complicated . 

According to Charles R. Cross in his 2001 Cobain biography Heavier Than Heaven , Cobain 's final straw with Foster came after Foster was arrested for assaulting the son of the mayor of Cosmopolis , Washington , which landed him in jail for two weeks , and caused him to have his driver 's license revoked , and being fined thousands of dollars in the victim 's medical expenses . 

Neither Cobain nor Novoselic informed Foster directly of his termination . 

According to Cross , Foster realized he was out of the band when he saw an advertisement for an upcoming Butthole Surfers show featuring Nirvana as the opening act . 

A lengthy termination note addressed to Foster was included , unsent , in Kurt Cobain 's published Journals , which while praising Foster 's drumming , also bemoans the difference in cultural background between Foster and Cobain , who both were Aberdeen natives . 

After being fired from Nirvana , Foster played with the bands Suckerpunch , Psycho Samaritan and Helltrout . 

He can be heard as a guest drummer on the Mico de Noche album called Cherries ( he plays on " Dirty Unicorn " and " Tu 's Place " ) .
