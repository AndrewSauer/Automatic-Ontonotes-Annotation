Domenico Trezzini ( c. 1670 â€“ 1734 ) was a Swiss Italian architect who elaborated the Petrine Baroque style of Russian architecture . 

Domenico was born in Astano , Landvogtei of Lugano ( at that time a condominium of the Old Swiss Confederacy ) , in the Italian - speaking Ticino . 

He probably studied in Rome . 

Subsequently , as he was working in Denmark , he was offered by Peter I of Russia , among other architects , to design buildings in the new Russian capital city , St. Petersburg . 

Since 1703 , when the city was founded , he substantially contributed to its most representative buildings . 

The Peter and Paul Fortress with the Peter and Paul Cathedral , the Twelve Collegia Building ( now the main building of Saint Petersburg University ) as well as Peter 's Summer House count among his many achievements . 

He also helped found and design Kronstadt and the Alexander Nevsky Monastery . 

Domenico Trezzini was very important for another aspect of Russian architectural history : in founding a school based on the European model , he laid the foundations for the development of the Petrine Baroque . 

As a testimony of the cordial relationship that linked Domenico Trezzini with the Tsar , his son Pietro ( who also became a noted architect , not to be confused with Pietro Antonio Trezzini ) had Peter I of Russia himself as a godfather .
