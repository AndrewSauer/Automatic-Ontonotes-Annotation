Lake Parime or Lake Parima is a legendary lake located in South America . 

It was reputedly the location of the fabled city of El Dorado , also known as Manoa , much sought - after by European explorers . 

Repeated attempts to find the lake failed to confirm its existence , and it was dismissed as a myth along with the city . 

The search for Lake Parime led explorers to map the rivers and other features of southern Venezuela , northern Brazil , and southwestern Guyana before the lake 's existence was definitively disproved in the early 19th century . 

Some explorers proposed that the seasonal flooding of the Rupununi savannah may have been misidentified as a lake . 

Recent geological investigations suggest that a lake may have existed in northern Brazil , but that it dried up some time in the 18th century . 

Both " Manoa " ( Arawak language ) and " Parime " ( Carib language ) are believed to mean " big lake " . 

Two other mythical lakes , Lake Xarayes or Xaraies ( sometimes called Lake Eupana ) , and Lake Cassipa , are often depicted on early maps of South America .
