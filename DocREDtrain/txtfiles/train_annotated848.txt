Christian Kramer ( died 1834 ) was a composer , arranger , musician and Master of the King 's Musick between 1829 and 1834 . 

He served under two British kings ; George IV and William IV . 

Kramer was born in Hannover and was a pupil of Romantic composer Peter Winter . 

He became a court musician , eventually rising to lead George IV 's personal orchestra ( " band " ) which , according to Dwight 's Journal of Music was " in its time acknowledged to be one of the best in Europe " . 

Notably , many of the musicians in his band were sourced from Germany . 

John Dwight goes on to note that he could play all of the instruments in his orchestra to a remarkable degree . 

A Dictionary of Musical Information of 1876 notes that he was " a composer of great ability " , although none of his compositions have remained in the repertoire . 

He was apparently on good terms with the king ; according to one account , like George IV , Kramer suffered from gout and was often inquired of by his master " after a simultaneous attack " .
