Fossò is a town and comune in the province of Venice , Veneto , Italy . 

It is west of SP13 . 

The town of Fossò is located in a fertile plain in the territory of the Riviera del Brenta , between Padua and Venice . 

The name may be derived from the Latin " Fossadum " , a ditch , with reference probably to a minor line of river Brenta . 

An old sale contract shows that this town was existing at least since 1073 onwards with the consequent assumption that a church was already built here , though we must wait until 1130 to find the first sure mention of the existence of a chapel dedicated to St. Bartholomew , in a letter of the bishop of Padua . 

In 1761 a new church was dedicated to St. Bartholomew to replace the previous one . 

In 1797 Napoleon Bonaparte arrived in Italy and with the Treaty of Campo Formio the glorious Republic of Venice ends forever . 

Under the role of the Napoleonic Kingdom of Italy , the municipalities of Fossò and Sandon are created in 1806 and assigned first to the current Province of Padua and then to the current Province of Venice , the year later . 

After World War II , Fossò had a good economic development , with the consequent urban expansion and substantial growth of the population , so that in 1957 it was necessary to build a new larger church . 

Nowadays , either the new and the old church , both dedicated to St. Bartholomew , are standing one opposite to the other on the main square of Fossò . 

The economical development transformed the town , once mostly agricultural , into a purely industrial and commercial place .
