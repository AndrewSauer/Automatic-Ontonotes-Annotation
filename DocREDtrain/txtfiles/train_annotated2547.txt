Eric Reed Boucher ( born June 17 , 1958 ) , better known by his professional name Jello Biafra , is the former lead singer and songwriter for the San Francisco punk rock band Dead Kennedys . 

He is a musician and spoken word artist . 

Initially active from 1979 to 1986 , Dead Kennedys were known for rapid - fire music topped with Biafra 's sardonic lyrics and biting social commentary , delivered in his " unique quiver of a voice . " 

When the band broke up in 1986 , he took over the influential independent record label Alternative Tentacles , which he had founded in 1979 with Dead Kennedys bandmate East Bay Ray . 

In a 2000 lawsuit , upheld on appeal in 2003 by the California Supreme Court , Biafra was found liable for breach of contract , fraud and malice in withholding a decade 's worth of royalties from his former bandmates and ordered to pay over $ 200,000 in compensation and punitive damages ; the band subsequently reformed without Biafra . 

Although now focused primarily on spoken word performances , Biafra has continued as a musician in numerous collaborations . 

Politically , Biafra is a member of the Green Party of the United States and supports various political causes . 

He ran for the party 's Presidential nomination in the 2000 United States Presidential Election , finishing a distant second to Ralph Nader . 

He is a staunch believer in a free society , and utilizes shock value and advocates direct action and pranksterism in the name of political causes . 

Biafra is known to use absurdist media tactics , in the leftist tradition of the Yippies , to highlight issues of civil rights and social justice .
