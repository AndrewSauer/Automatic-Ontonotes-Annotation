Fictionalized portrayals of George W. Bush , the 43rd President of the United States , have become common since his inauguration on January 20 , 2001 . 

Many popular TV shows , magazines , books and comics have portrayed or satirized him . 

Several comedians and comic actors were known for impressions of Bush during his presidency , including Will Ferrell and Will Forte ( both originally on Saturday Night Live ) , Jon Culshaw , Frank Caliendo , James Adomian and Jon Stewart . 

Impressionist Steve Bridges had a notably involved impression that included facial prosthetics to achieve similarity to Bush ; he impersonated Bush in a variety of settings , including once alongside the real President Bush at the 2006 White House Correspondents ' Association dinner . 

Actor Timothy Bottoms portrayed Bush fictionally multiple times during the Bush presidency : in the Comedy Central sitcom That 's My Bush ! , as a cameo in the family film , and in a serious role in the telefilm DC 9/11 ( 2003 ) . 

Bush was the target of satire for most of his presidency . 

Most fictional depictions of the President in popular media tend to emphasize his drawl and tendency to use incorrect grammar and malapropisms in speeches , as well as his sometimes awkward hand and facial gestures . 

Bush is often depicted in caricatures with a large nose and ears , and small eyes , giving him a somewhat elfin appearance , or sometimes to look similar to a chimpanzee . 

He is also sometimes drawn in political cartoons as being short in stature , although in reality he is taller than the average American . 

Most fictionalized portrayals of George W. Bush have been negative , which some conservatives claim is reflective of a leftist media bias .
