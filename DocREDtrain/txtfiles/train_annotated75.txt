The Club Paradise Tour was the second headlining tour by Canadian recording artist , Drake . 

The tour came following the release of Drake 's second studio album , Take Care . 

The tour 's name spins off from the 2011 song " Club Paradise " , a promotional single released ahead of the release of Take Care , which , in turn , borrowed its name from a strip club in Toronto . 

An official poster for the tour was released along with the announcement of the venture , showing Drake in the same room as is on the album cover , expressing the despondent conflicting stance about growing wealth and fame prevalent in the album . 

The tour featured Kendrick Lamar and A$ AP Rocky as opening acts for the majority of the dates throughout the tour , with various acts being added as the tour expanded beyond North America . 

Due to the large demand and tickets selling out in minutes in multiple locations , extra tour dates were added to the itinerary , which included a second leg across the United States . 

The tour became a commercial success , grossing $ 42 million in the tour 's duration . 

It was the highest - grossing hip - hop tour of 2012 , according to Pollstar 's annual year end tour chart .
