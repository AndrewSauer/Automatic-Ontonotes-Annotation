Queequeg is a fictional character in the 1851 novel Moby - Dick by American author Herman Melville . 

The son of a South Sea chieftain who left home to explore the world , Queequeg is the first principal character encountered by the narrator , Ishmael . 

The quick friendship and relationship of equality between the tattooed cannibal and the white sailor shows Melville 's basic theme of shipboard democracy and racial diversity . 

Once aboard the whaling ship Pequod Queequeg becomes the harpooner for the mate Starbuck . 

At the end of the novel he " casts the runes " , which say he will die . 

He therefore builds a coffin and refuses to eat or drink , but ultimately decides to stay alive and then recovers . 

The coffin is later converted to a lifebuoy after the ship 's original one is lost . 

When Moby - Dick sinks the ship , Ishmael survives by clinging to it until another ship arrives to pick him up .
