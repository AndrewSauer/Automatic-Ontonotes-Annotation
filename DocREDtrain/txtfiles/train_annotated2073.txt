Dorothea Christiane Erxleben née Leporin ( 13 November 1715 , Quedlinburg – 13 June 1762 in Quedlinburg ) was the first female medical doctor in Germany . 

Erxleben was instructed in medicine by her father from an early age . 

The Italian scientist Laura Bassi 's university professorship inspired Erxleben to fight for her right to practise medicine . 

In 1742 , she published a tract arguing that women should be allowed to attend university . 

After being admitted to study by a dispensation of Frederick the Great , Erxleben received her MD from the University of Halle in 1754 . 

She was the first German woman to receive a MD . 

She went on to analyse the obstacles preventing women from studying , among them housekeeping and children .
