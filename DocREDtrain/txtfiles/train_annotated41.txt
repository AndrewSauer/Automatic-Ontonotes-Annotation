Maya Ballgame , which is a branch of the Mesoamerican Ballgame , is an sport event that was played throughout the Maya civilization . 

The Maya civilization was spread out throughout much of Central America . 

One of the common links of the Mayan culture of Mexico , Guatemala , Honduras , and Belize is the game played with a rubber ball , about which we have learned from several sources . 

Maya ballgame was played with big stone courts . 

The ball court itself was a focal point of Maya cities and symbolized the city â€™s wealth and power . 

The playing arena was in the shape of an I with high platforms on either side of the court allowing for large numbers of spectators . 

Portable stone court markers known as hacha usually depicting animals or skulls were placed around the arena . 

The game was played for 2 weeks .
