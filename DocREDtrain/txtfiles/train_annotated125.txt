The Swedish Armed Forces ( , literally “ the Defense Force ” ) is the government agency that forms the military forces of Sweden , and which is tasked with defence of the country , as well as promoting Sweden 's wider interests , supporting international peacekeeping efforts , and providing humanitarian aid . 

It consists of : the Swedish Army , the Swedish Air Force and the Swedish Navy , with addition of a military reserve force , the Home Guard ( ) . 

Since 1994 , all the Swedish armed services are organised within a single unified government agency , headed by the Supreme Commander , even though the individual services maintain their distinct identities . 

King Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden is traditionally attributed as Honorary General and Admiral à la suite . 

The military history of Sweden includes several unions and wars with all of its neighbour states , including extended Swedish intervention in the Thirty Years ' War at the times of the Swedish Empire during the 17th and early 18th centuries . 

Wars with Russia culminated in the Finnish War ( 1808 – 1809 ) , with Sweden losing Finland . 

During the World Wars , the Cold War and throughout the 20th century , Sweden maintained a national policy of non - alignment , while the Swedish Armed Forces strength was based upon the concepts of conscription . 

In 2010 , peacetime conscription was abolished , replacing it with volunteer armed forces including the Home Guard – National Security Force until 2018 . 

Units from the Swedish Armed Forces are currently on deployment in several international operations either actively or as military observers , including Afghanistan as part of ISAF and in Kosovo . 

Moreover , Swedish Armed Forces contribute as the lead nation for an EU Battle Group approximately once every three years .
