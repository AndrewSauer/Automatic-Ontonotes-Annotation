The CBC Tower , also known as the WesTower Transmission Tower , was a 371 metre high guyed mast for FM- and TV - transmission located atop Mont - Carmel near Shawinigan , Quebec , Canada . 

The tower was built in 1972 and it served for several decades as Quebec 's primary CBC transmission point and also served several radio and television stations for the Trois - Rivi√®res market . 

On April 22 , 2001 a lone pilot , Gilbert Paquette , flew his Cessna 150 into the tower and was killed . 

The fuselage of the plane remained wedged in the upper part of the tower , with the pilot 's body inside . 

The crash also knocked the tower several metres off balance . 

It was decided that due to the structural damage and the need to recover the pilot 's body the mast would have to be demolished . 

Several days later a controlled implosion brought the tower down , not damaging the several buildings nearby . 

It was the tallest structure ever implosively demolished . 

The mast was later replaced by a new mast near the same site .
