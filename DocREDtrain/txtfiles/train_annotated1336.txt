The Australian Fabians ( also known as the Australian Fabian Society ) was established in 1947 . 

Inspired by the Fabian Society in the United Kingdom , it is dedicated to Fabianism , the focus on the advancement of socialist ideas through gradual influence and patiently promoting socialist ideals to intellectual circles and groups with power . 

An earlier experiment with Fabianism in Australia was initiated in Adelaide in 1891 by the Rev Charles Marson , who had joined the Fabians in London in 1885 and drew in trade unionists like David Charleston , Robert Guthrie and John McPherson as well as social reformers like James & Lucy Morice into the first overseas branch of the UK Fabian Society . 

The Australian members retained their membership for ten years until the Adelaide branch was wound up in 1902 . 

The Australian Fabians have historically had close ties with the Australian Labor Party ( ALP ) . 

This is evidenced by the number of past ALP prime ministers , federal ministers and state premiers who were active members of the Australian Fabians while in office . 

The role of patron of the Australian Fabians is filled by media and Social Commentator and progressive thinker , Eva Cox , but was previously filled by former Australian prime minister , the late Gough Whitlam . 

This is a temporary arrangement and the position will be filled when an appropriate person to fund and uphold the society 's values is found . 

The Australian Fabians have had a significant influence on public policy development in Australia since the Second World War , with many of its members having held influential political offices in Australian governments .
