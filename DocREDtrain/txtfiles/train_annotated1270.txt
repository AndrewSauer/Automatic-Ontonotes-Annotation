" Harlem Shake " is a song recorded by American DJ and producer Baauer . 

It was released as his debut single on May 22 , 2012 , by Mad Decent imprint label Jeffree 's . 

The uptempo song — variously described as trap , hip hop or bass music — incorporates a mechanical bassline , Dutch house synth riffs , a dance music drop , and samples of growling - lion sounds . 

It also samples Plastic Little 's 2001 song " Miller Time " , specifically the vocal " then do the Harlem shake " , which is an allusion to the dance of the same name . 

Baauer added a variety of peculiar sounds to the song so that it would stand out . 

The single did not begin to sell significantly until February 2013 , when a YouTube video set to its music developed into an Internet meme of the same name . 

The media response to the meme helped increase the single 's sales , as it charted at number one for five consecutive weeks on the US Billboard Hot 100 . 

It also reached number three in the United Kingdom and number one in both Australia and New Zealand . 

During the song 's chart run , Billboard enacted a policy that included video streams as a component of their charts . 

" Harlem Shake " was well received by music critics , who viewed it as an appealing dance track , although some felt that it was more of a novelty song . 

After the song became a hit , Mad Decent label head Diplo reached an agreement with the artists of the song 's samples , which had not been contractually cleared before its release . 

However , according to Baauer , he has not received any of the money the song made because of the legal issues from not having properly cleared the samples . 

American rapper Azealia Banks released a remix to " Harlem Shake " on her SoundCloud page , which was subsequently removed at Baauer 's request and led to a dispute between the two .
