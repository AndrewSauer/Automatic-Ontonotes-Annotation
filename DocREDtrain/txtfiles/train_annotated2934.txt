" Coming Down Again " is a song by the Rolling Stones featured on their 1973 album Goats Head Soup . 

It is sung as a duet by Keith Richards and Mick Jagger . 

Credited to Jagger / Richards , " Coming Down Again " is largely the work of Richards , who went as far as to say " ' Coming Down Again ' is my song " at the time of its release . 

A slower ballad similar in mood to another track on the album , " Angie " , the lyrics tell of Richards ' relationship with then - girlfriend Anita Pallenberg , who had chosen to abandon her romantic liaison with his friend and bandmate Brian Jones in favour of one with Richards . 

The song opens with Stones recording veteran Nicky Hopkins playing keyboards alongside a fluid , prominent bassline performed by Mick Taylor . 

Guitars are performed by Richards , who uses the wah - wah pedal for much of the song ( an effect used often on Goats Head Soup ) , as well as Leslie speakers . 

Charlie Watts performs a " trademark start - stop drum arrangement ... that by now had become a familiar device . " 

Bobby Keys performs a saxophone solo near the middle of the song . 

Jagger gives support to Richards on backing vocals . 

Recorded in Kingston 's Dynamic Sound Studios in November and December , 1972 , " Coming Down Again " is regarded as one of Richards ' best lead vocal performances . 

Despite some popularity , Richards has never performed the song live on tour with the Rolling Stones .
