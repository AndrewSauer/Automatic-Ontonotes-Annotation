A switchblade ( also known as an automatic knife , pushbutton knife , ejector knife , switch , Sprenger , Springer , flick knife , or flick blade ) is a type of knife with a folding or sliding blade contained in the handle which is opened automatically by a spring when a button , lever , or switch on the handle or bolster is stroked . 

Most switchblade designs incorporate a locking blade , in which the blade is locked against closure when the spring extends the blade to the fully opened position . 

The blade is unlocked by manually operating a mechanism that unlocks the blade and allows it to be folded and locked in the closed position . 

In 1954 , Democratic Rep. James J. Delaney of New York authored the first bill submitted to the U.S. Congress banning the manufacture and sale of switchblades , beginning a wave of legal restrictions worldwide and a consequent decline in their popularity . 

In 1955 , U.S. newspapers promoted the image of a young delinquent with a stiletto switchblade or flick knife with lurid stories of urban youth gang warfare , often featuring lower class youth and/or racial minorities .
