The Ministry of Home Security was a British government department established in 1939 to direct national civil defence ( primarily tasked with organising air raid precautions ) during the Second World War . 

The Ministry for Home Security was headed by Sir John Anderson the Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security . 

The Ministry 's responsibilities covered all central and regional civil defence organisations ( such as air raid wardens , rescue squads , fire services , and the Women â€™s Voluntary Service ) . 

It was also responsible for giving approval to local ARP schemes , and providing public shelters . 

The Ministry ( run under the auspices of the Home Office ) produced hundreds of leaflets that were delivered to the population advising on how to deal with the impending air raids . 

It also managed propaganda poster campaigns to encourage , amongst other things , the carrying of gas masks and for volunteers to join civil defence groups like the Fire Guards . 

In October 1940 , Sir John Anderson was replaced by Herbert Morrison in a reshuffle precipitated by Neville Chamberlain 's resignation due to ill - health . 

With the Allied victory in Europe the Ministry was disbanded in May 1945 .
