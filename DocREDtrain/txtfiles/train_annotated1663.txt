Zombie Army Trilogy is a third - person tactical shooter stealth video game developed and published by Rebellion Developments . 

It is a spin - off to the Sniper Elite series , released on March 6 , 2015 for Microsoft Windows , PlayStation 4 and Xbox One . 

The premise of the game is that , in an alternative version of the final days of World War II , with the German army close to defeat , Adolf Hitler deploys a last resort plan to raise the fallen as zombies through occult rituals and turn them against Allied forces , thus causing Germany to become overrun with the undead . 

The trilogy includes a remastered version of the original and its sequel , which were both released in 2013 as standalone downloadable content for Sniper Elite V2 , and a previously unreleased third installment in the series . 

The game , which can be played co - operatively or solo , features the single - player campaigns of the first two Nazi Zombie Army titles , alongside the new third chapter , combined into one Campaign mode , with a Horde mode similar to Killing Floor and the aforementioned Left 4 Dead series also being available . 

The game 's co - operative modes support eight playable characters , four of which are new female characters . 

In August 2015 , the main characters of both games in the Left 4 Dead series were also added exclusively to the PC version 's playable character roster .
