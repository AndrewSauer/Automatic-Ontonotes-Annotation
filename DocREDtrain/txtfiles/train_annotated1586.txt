The Rubettes were an English pop band put together by musician John Richardson in 1974 after the release of " Sugar Baby Love " , a recording assembled of studio session musicians in 1973 by the songwriting team of Wayne Bickerton , then the head of A&R ; at Polydor Records , and his co - songwriter , Tony Waddington , after their doo - wop and 1950s American pop - influenced songs had been rejected by a number of existing acts . 

Waddington paired the group with manager John Morris , the husband of singer Clodagh Rodgers and under his guidance , the band duly emerged at the tail end of the glam rock movement , wearing trademark white suits and cloth caps on stage . 

Their first release , " Sugar Baby Love " was an instant hit remaining at number one in the United Kingdom for four weeks in May 1974 , while reaching number 37 on the US chart that August , and remains their best - known record . 

Subsequent releases were to be less successful , but the band continued to tour well into the 2000s with two line - ups in existence .
