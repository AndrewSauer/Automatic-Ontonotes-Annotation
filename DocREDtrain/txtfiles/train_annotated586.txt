The historic county of Middlesex in south east England was represented in Parliament from the 13th century . 

This article provides a list of constituencies constituting the Parliamentary representation from Middlesex . 

From early times the City of London and the rest of Middlesex had different sheriffs and other administrative arrangements . 

However apart from this the historic county was not divided , for administrative purposes , until 1889 . 

In that year the urbanised east of the county became part of the new administrative county of London ; administered by the London County Council . 

The less built up north and west of the county formed the administrative county of Middlesex ; administered by Middlesex County Council . 

In 1965 the Greater London Council was formed . 

Greater London absorbed the administrative county of London and surrounding territory , including almost all of the administrative county of Middlesex . 

The south west part of the historic county ( then the Staines Urban District and the Sunbury on Thames Urban District but from 1974 the borough of Spelthorne ) was transferred to the administrative county of Surrey . 

A smaller part of the historic county , in the Potters Bar area , was transferred to the administrative county of Hertfordshire . 

In 1995 the village of Poyle , which had been a small area in the north of Spelthorne , was transferred to Berkshire . 

The first part of this article covers the constituencies wholly or predominantly within the area of the historic county of Middlesex , both before and after the administrative changes of 1889 and 1965 . 

The second part refers to constituencies mostly in another historic county , which included some territory from the historic county of Middlesex . 

The summaries section only refers to the constituencies included in the first section of the constituency list .
