Rothe House is a late 16th - century merchant 's townhouse complex located in the city of Kilkenny . 

The complex was built by John Rothe Fitz - Piers between 1594 – 1610 and is made up of three houses , three enclosed courtyards , and a large reconstructed garden with orchard . 

Rothe House is the only remaining example of its type in Ireland , and considered to be nationally significant because of the range of original post - medieval features that survive . 

The property , an important element of Kilkenny 's heritage , is owned by the Kilkenny Archaeological Society and houses some of the society 's collection of artefacts relating to Kilkenny City , County and Ireland . 

The garden to the rear of the house has been reconstructed to reflect a typical 17th - century garden . 

The burgage plot on which Rothe House was built survives intact – one of a few in such an unaltered state . 

Kilkenny 's medieval city wall forms part of the curtilage of the Rothe House complex .
