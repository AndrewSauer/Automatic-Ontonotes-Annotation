The Kingdom of Africa was an extension of the frontier zone of the Siculo - Norman state in the former Roman province of Africa ( Ifrīqiya in Tunisian Arabic ) , corresponding to Tunisia and parts of Algeria and Libya today . 

The main primary sources for the kingdom are Arabic ( Muslim ) ; the Latin ( Christian ) sources are scanter . 

According to Hubert Houben , since " Africa " was never mentioned in the royal title of the kings of Sicily , " one ought not to speak of a ‘ Norman kingdom of Africa’ . " 

Rather , " [ Norman Africa ] really amounted to a constellation of Norman - held towns along coastal Ifrīqiya . " 

The Sicilian conquest of Africa began under Roger II in 1146 – 48 . 

Sicilian rule consisted of military garrisons in the major towns , exactions on the local Muslim population , protection of Christians , and the minting of coin . 

The local aristocracy was largely left in place , and Muslim princes controlled the civil government under Sicilian oversight . 

Economic connections between Sicily and Africa , which were strong before the conquest , were strengthened , while ties between Africa and northern Italy were expanded . 

Early in the reign of William I , the Kingdom of Africa fell to the Almohad Caliphate ( 1158 – 60 ) . 

Its most enduring legacy was the realignment of Mediterranean powers brought about by its demise and the Siculo - Almohad peace finalised in 1180 .
