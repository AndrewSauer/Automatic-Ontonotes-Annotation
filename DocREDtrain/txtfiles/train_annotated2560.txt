Store Torungen Lighthouse ( ) is a coastal lighthouse on the island of Store Torungen in the municipality of Arendal in Aust - Agder county , Norway . 

This lighthouse , together with the nearby Lille Torungen Lighthouse , mark the entrance from the Skaggerak through the outlying islands to the mainland town of Arendal . 

Both lighthouses were built in 1844 with the same specifications , making " twin " lighthouses marking the way to Arendal . 

The two lighthouses were put on the coat - of - arms for the local municipality of His√∏y in which the lighthouses were located . 

Over time , both lighthouses were replaced , and the only one still standing is the Lille Torungen Lighthouse , although it is no longer in use . 

The site of the Store Torungen Lighthouse is accessible only by boat . 

The island and site is open to the public , the tower is open daily during the summers , and the lighthouse keepers house is available to rent for overnight accommodations .
