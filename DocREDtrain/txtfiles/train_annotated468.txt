Jan Šťastný ( c.1764 – c.1830 ) ( also Stiasny , Stiastny ) was a Czech composer and cellist from the end of the 18th century to the beginning of the 19th century . 

He is considered one of the founders of Czech national violoncello school . 

Information on Šťastný 's life is rather sketchy . 

He was born around 1764 in Prague , was taught music by his father , and played in a Prague theatre orchestra by 16 years . 

In 1810 , Šťastný was court cellist in Frankfurt ( c. 1810 – 1814 ) . 

He then worked in Mannheim , and was music director in Nuremberg around 1820 . 

Apparently at some point he lived and worked in England , where in London he met Czech singer and composer Josef Theodor Krov , who called Šťastný , the " Beethoven of the violoncello " . 

Traces of Šťastný disappear after 1826 . 

Šťastný 's cello and basso continuo composition is regarded , in the opinion of violinist , conductor , and cello music historian Wilhelm Joseph von Wasielewski , as one of the best examples of antique cello compositions . 

He composed cello pieces ( 11 opus numbers ) , duets , variations , sonatas , divertimento , instructive pieces , concertino , Grand Trio .
