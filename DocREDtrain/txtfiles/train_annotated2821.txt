Faurot Field , at Memorial Stadium is a stadium in Columbia , Missouri , United States , on the campus of the University of Missouri . 

It is primarily used for football and serves as the home field for the Missouri Tigers football program . 

It is the second - largest sports facility by seating capacity in the state of Missouri , to Arrowhead Stadium in Kansas City . 

In 1972 , Memorial Stadium 's playing surface was named Faurot Field in honor of longtime coach Don Faurot . 

During the offseason , soccer goals are set up in the end zones and it is used for intramural matches . 

Until 2012 it was the site of the annual " Providence Bowl " game between Hickman and Rock Bridge high schools , so named because both schools are located on Providence Road in Columbia , and Faurot is roughly equidistant between the two . 

This tradition stopped when Missouri joined the Southeastern Conference and conference scheduling made hosting the game more difficult . 

Faurot Field was also home to the Missouri State High School Activities Association ( MSHSAA ) football championships for many years , now held in St. Louis in the climate - controlled Dome at America 's Center . 

The stadium is an early 20th century horseshoe - shaped stadium , with seating added on in the " open " ( south ) end zone . 

The original horseshoe is completed by a grass berm in the curved end , which is used for general admission on game days . 

The berm is famous for the giant block " M " made of painted white stones located behind the end zone . 

A paved path encircled the west , north and east sides of the field taking the place of the track , but was removed in 1994 .
