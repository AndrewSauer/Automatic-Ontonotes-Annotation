This was confirmed with a declaration of independence by the Montenegrin parliament on 3 June 2006 .

Russia gave official recognition on 11 June , 2006 , and was the first permanent member of the United Nations Security Council to do so . 

The European Council of Ministers recognized Montenegrin independence on 12 June , as did the United States . 

The United Kingdom extended recognition on 13 June .
