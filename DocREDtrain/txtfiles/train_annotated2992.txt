This a list of votes of no confidence in British governments led by Prime Ministers of the former Kingdom of Great Britain and the United Kingdom . 

The first such motion of no confidence to defeat a ministry was in 1742 against Sir Robert Walpole , a Whig who served from 1721 to 1742 and was the de facto first Prime Minister to hold office . 

Thereafter there have been 21 votes of confidence successfully motioned against British governments . 

The most recent was held against the Callaghan ministry in March 1979 . 

Following the defeat , Prime Minister James Callaghan was forced to hold a general election by May ; he was defeated by Margaret Thatcher of the Conservative Party . 

Before the vote in 1979 , the most recent vote of no confidence in a British government was in 1924 , the longest interval in British parliamentary history .
