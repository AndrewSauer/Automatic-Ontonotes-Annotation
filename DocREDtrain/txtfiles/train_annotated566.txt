Gopeng is a town located in Mukim Teja , Kampar District , Perak , Malaysia . 

It is situated approximately 20   km south of Ipoh , the state capital . 

The town is located on the west side of the North - South Expressway stretch of Tapah - Simpang Pulai . 

The limestone hills and the Titiwangsa Mountains are clearly visible ; the expressway penetrates between them and the view of the Tapah - Gopeng stretch is one of the most picturesque areas on the west side of Peninsular Malaysia . 

Once this town was bustling with tin miners and locals who busied themselves with the great tin mining industry of Malaysia until the collapse of the tin empire in 1980s . 

The name for Gopeng was named by a Chinese called Mo Peng ( 毛兵 ) , but the British changed its name to Go Peng as the name is hard to pronounce . 

According to locals , there were once French , British and local tin mining companies developing tin mine industry there . 

Among them was called the Osbourne & Chappel which opened its franchise here in one of Gopeng 's rich tin mine . 

Both locals and immigrants worked there . 

People started to flee the town and seek better opportunities in neighboring towns and cities soon after the collapse of the 1980s . 

However , the love towards the town has never been faded and now Gopeng already flourished with heritage , cuisine and eco - tourism attractions developed by the locals themselves . 

Gopeng is also well known for limestone caves such as Gua Tempurung , located approximately 5   km from the town centre .
