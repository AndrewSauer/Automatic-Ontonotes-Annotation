Jean Piaget ( , ; ; 9 August 1896 â€“ 16 September 1980 ) was a Swiss psychologist known for his work on child development . 

Piaget 's theory of cognitive development and epistemological view are together called " genetic epistemology " . 

Piaget placed great importance on the education of children . 

As the Director of the International Bureau of Education , he declared in 1934 that " only education is capable of saving our societies from possible collapse , whether violent , or gradual . " 

His theory of child development is studied in pre - service education programs . 

Educators continue to incorporate constructivist - based strategies . 

Piaget created the International Center for Genetic Epistemology in Geneva in 1955 while on the faculty of the University of Geneva and directed the Center until his death in 1980 . 

The number of collaborations that its founding made possible , and their impact , ultimately led to the Center being referred to in the scholarly literature as " Piaget 's factory " . 

According to Ernst von Glasersfeld , Jean Piaget was " the great pioneer of the constructivist theory of knowing . " 

However , his ideas did not become widely popularized until the 1960s . 

This then led to the emergence of the study of development as a major sub - discipline in psychology . 

By the end of the 20th century , Piaget was second only to B. F. Skinner as the most cited psychologist of that era .
