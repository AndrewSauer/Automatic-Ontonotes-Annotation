New political thinking ( or simply " new thinking " ) was the doctrine put forth by Mikhail Gorbachev as part of his reforms of the Soviet Union . 

Its major elements were deideologization of international politics , abandoning the concept of class struggle , priority of universal human interests over the interests of any class , increasing interdependence of the world , mutual security based on political rather than military instruments , which constituted a significant shift from the previous principles of the Soviet foreign politics . 

In 1987 Gorbachev published the book Perestroika and New Political Thinking and in December 1988 he presented the doctrine of new thinking in his speech to the United Nations . 

The " new thinking " was of vital necessity for the Soviet Union to shut down the costly Cold War competition in order to continue internal economic reforms of perestroika . 

Notable steps in this direction included Intermediate - Range Nuclear Forces Treaty , Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan , stopped support of communist movements around the world and loosened grip over the Eastern Europe by replacing the Brezhnev Doctrine with Sinatra Doctrine . 

In 1990 Gorbachev was awarded the Nobel Prize for Peace " for his leading role in the peace process " . 

The overall effect of these developments was the end of the Cold War , the breakdown of the Soviet Empire and ultimately of the Soviet Union itself .
