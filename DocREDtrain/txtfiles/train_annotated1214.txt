Kissel or kisel ( , , , , , , , , , , kisél ' ) is a viscous fruit dish , popular as a dessert and as a drink . 

It consists of the sweetened juice of berries , like mors , but it is thickened with cornstarch , potato starch or arrowroot ; sometimes red wine or fresh or dried fruits are added . 

It is similar to the Danish rødgrød and German Rote Grütze . 

Swedish blåbärssoppa is a similarly prepared bilberry dessert . 

Kissel can be served either hot or cold , also together with sweetened quark or semolina pudding . 

Kissel can also be served on pancakes or with ice cream . 

If the kissel is made using less thickening starch , it can be drunk — this is common in Poland , Russia and Ukraine .
