" The People " is a song by American rapper Common , released as the second single of his seventh studio album Finding Forever . 

It made its first appearance on Kanye West 's Ca n't Tell Me Nothing mixtape . 

The song features production by West and contains background vocals provided by soul singer Dwele . 

The original version of the song had Common singing the hook by himself , but this was later replaced with Dwele singing the hook . 

It contains samples of " We Almost Lost Detroit " by Gil Scott - Heron as well as vocal samples of " Long Red " by Mountain ( the latter of which was sampled on Would n't Get Far featuring West ) . 

This action was part of West 's intention to pay tribute to J Dilla through the production style expressed within the album . 

Though it performed moderately on the charts , " The People " became one of the most critically acclaimed songs of the year . 

The song was listed at number twenty - nine on Rolling Stone 's the 100 Best Songs of 2007 . 

It also received a nomination for Best Rap Solo Performance at the 50th Grammy Awards .
