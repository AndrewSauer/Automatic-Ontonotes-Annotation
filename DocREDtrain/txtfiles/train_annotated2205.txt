The Great Depression in the United Kingdom , also known as the Great Slump , was a period of national economic downturn in the 1930s , which had its origins in the global Great Depression . 

It was Britain 's largest and most profound economic depression of the 20th century . 

The Great Depression originated in the United States in late 1929 and quickly spread to the world . 

Britain had never experienced the boom that had characterized the U.S. , Germany , Canada and Australia in the 1920s , so its effect appeared less severe . 

Britain 's world trade fell by half ( 1929â€“33 ) , the output of heavy industry fell by a third , employment profits plunged in nearly all sectors . 

At the depth in summer 1932 , registered unemployed numbered 3.5 million , and many more had only part - time employment . 

Particularly hardest hit by economic problems were the industrial and mining areas in the north of England , Scotland , Northern Ireland and Wales . 

Unemployment reached 70 % in some areas at the start of the 1930s ( with more than 3 million out of work nationally ) and many families depended entirely on payments from local government known as the dole . 

Politically the Conservative Party dominated the era and the Labour Party was seriously hurt .
