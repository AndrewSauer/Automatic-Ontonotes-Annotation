Saturday Nights & Sunday Mornings is the fifth studio album by Counting Crows , released in the United States on March 25 , 2008 . 

It is thematically divided into two sides : the rock music of Saturday Nights and the more country - influenced Sunday Mornings . 

Vocalist and lyricist Adam Duritz states that the album " is about really wanting to mean something and failing to do it . 

You want your life to mean something . 

You want to be somebody and then what you turn out to be is so much less than what you thought you were going to be . " 

The Saturday Nights portion was produced by Gil Norton ( who also produced the band 's second album , Recovering the Satellites ) , while Sunday Mornings was produced by Brian Deck , perhaps best known for his production work on Modest Mouse 's album The Moon and Antarctica . 

The album debuted at number 3 on the Billboard 200 , the band 's highest peak since Recovering the Satellites and it sold 106,000 copies in first week .
