The city of Athens ( , Athênai ] ; Modern Greek : Ἀθῆναι , Athínai ) during the classical period of Ancient Greece ( 508–322 BC ) was the major urban center of the notable polis ( city - state ) of the same name , located in Attica , Greece , leading the Delian League in the Peloponnesian War against Sparta and the Peloponnesian League . 

Athenian democracy was established in 508 BC under Cleisthenes following the tyranny of Isagoras . 

This system remained remarkably stable , and with a few brief interruptions remained in place for 180 years , until 322 BC ( aftermath of Lamian War ) . 

The peak of Athenian hegemony was achieved in the 440s to 430s BC , known as the Age of Pericles . 

In the classical period , Athens was a center for the arts , learning and philosophy , home of Plato 's Akademia and Aristotle 's Lyceum , Athens was also the birthplace of Socrates , Plato , Pericles , Aristophanes , Sophocles , and many other prominent philosophers , writers and politicians of the ancient world . 

It is widely referred to as the cradle of Western Civilization , and the birthplace of democracy , largely due to the impact of its cultural and political achievements during the 5th and 4th centuries BC on the rest of the then - known European continent .
