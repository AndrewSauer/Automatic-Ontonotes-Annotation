Stop Wasting Food ( ) is a Danish consumer organization that works for the reduction of food waste in society . 

It was established in 2008 by Selina Juul , who acts as the movement 's day - to - day leader and spokesperson . 

The organization is run by volunteers and does not count on a permanent membership . 

The goal of Stop Wasting Food is to spread the message that it is economically irresponsible to dispose of edible food at any point in the food - production chain , from producers to shops and restaurants to homes . 

The Danish Agriculture and Food Council has estimated that Denmark wastes over 700,000 tons of food annually , at a cost of DKK 11.6 billion . 

Stop Wasting Food , and its spokesperson Selina Juul , has received support from Danish politicians such as Eva Kjer Hansen , Poul Nyrup Rasmussen , Ritt Bjerregaard , Connie Hedegaard , Bertel Haarder , Frank Jensen , Dan Jørgensen , Karen Ellemann , Henrik Høegh and Kirsten Brosbøl , as well as food industry figures such as Rema 1000 and Coop Danmark . 

In part due to the Stop Wasting Food movement , Denmark was able to reduce its food waste by 25 % in the five - year period of 2010 – 2015 .
