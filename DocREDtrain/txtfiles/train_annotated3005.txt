Tin Pan Alley Cats is a 1943 animated short subject , directed by Bob Clampett for Leon Schlesinger Productions as part of Warner Bros. ' Merrie Melodies series . 

A follow - up to Clampett 's successful Coal Black and de Sebben Dwarfs , released earlier in 1943 , Tin Pan Alley Cats focuses upon contemporary themes of African - American culture , jazz music , and World War II , and features a caricature of jazz musician Fats Waller as an anthropomorphic cat . 

The short 's centerpiece is a fantasy sequence derived from Clampett 's black and white Looney Tunes short Porky in Wackyland ( 1938 ) . 

Like Coal Black , Tin Pan Alley Cats focuses heavily on stereotypical gags , character designs , and situations involving African - Americans . 

As such , the film and other Warner Bros. cartoons with similar themes have been withheld from television distribution since 1968 , and are collectively known as the Censored Eleven .
