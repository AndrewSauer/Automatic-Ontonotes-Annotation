This article is about the demographic features of the population of the Republic of the Congo , including population density , ethnicity , education level , health of the populace , economic status , religious affiliations and other aspects of the population . 

The Republic of the Congo 's sparse population is concentrated in the southwestern portion of the country , leaving the vast areas of tropical jungle in the north virtually uninhabited . 

Thus , Congo is one of the most urbanized countries in Africa , with 85 % of its total population living in a few urban areas , namely in Brazzaville , Pointe - Noire , or one of the small cities or villages lining the railway which connects the two cities . 

In rural areas , industrial and commercial activity has declined rapidly in recent years , leaving rural economies dependent on the government for support and subsistence . 

Before the 1997 war , about 15,000 Europeans and other non - Africans lived in Congo , most of whom were French . 

Presently , only about 9,500 remain . 

Pygmies make up 2 % of Congo 's population .
