Gianluca Forcolin ( born 28 August 1968 in San Donà di Piave ) is a Venetist politician from Veneto , Italy . 

A member of Liga Veneta – Lega Nord since 1993 , Forcolin was long involved in municipal politics in his hometown , Musile di Piave , of which he had been councillor , assessor , deputy mayor and finally mayor from 2007 to 2015 . 

In the 2008 general election he was elected to the Chamber of Deputies , where he sat in the Finance Committee , but did not stand for re - election five years later because he , a Venetist close to Luca Zaia as well as loyal to former Lega Nord leader Umberto Bossi , was not popular with the new leadership led by Flavio Tosi . 

He was even suspended from the party for ten months by the local leader Daniele Stival . 

In 2015 , after Tosi was sidelined by the federal party , Forcolin made his comeback : he was elected to the Regional Council as the most voted candidate of Liga Veneta in the province of Venice and Zaia , who had been re - elected President , appointed him Vice President and minister of Budget and Local Government .
