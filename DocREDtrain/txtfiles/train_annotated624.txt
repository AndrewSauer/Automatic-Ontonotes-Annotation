Khan Tervel ( ) also called Tarvel , or Terval , or Terbelis in some Byzantine sources , was the Khan of Bulgaria during the First Bulgarian Empire at the beginning of the 8th century . 

In 705 Emperor Justinian II named him Caesar , the first foreigner to receive this title . 

He was a Christian like his grandfather Khan Kubrat . 

Tervel played an important role in defeating the Arabs during the Siege of Constantinople in 717 – 718 . 

The Nominalia of the Bulgarian khans states that Tervel belonged to the Dulo clan and reigned for 21 years . 

According to the chronology developed by Moskov , Tervel would have reigned 695–715 . 

Other chronologies place his reign in 701 – 718 or 700 – 721 , but can not be reconciled with the testimony of the Imennik . 

The testimony of the source and some later traditions allow identifying Tervel as the son and heir of his predecessor Asparukh , who had perhaps died in battle against the Khazars . 

The Emperor Tervel is a Bulgarian Saint , painted in many medieval and renaissance frescoes in many churches and monasteries in Bulgaria .
