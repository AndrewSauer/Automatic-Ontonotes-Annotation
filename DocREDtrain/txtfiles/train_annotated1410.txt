Religion in pre - Islamic Arabia was a mix of polytheism , Christianity , Judaism , and Iranian religions . 

Arab polytheism , the dominant form of religion in pre - Islamic Arabia , was based on veneration of deities and other rituals . 

Gods and goddesses , including Hubal and the goddesses al - Lāt , Al-‘Uzzá and Manāt , were worshipped at local shrines such as the Kaaba in Mecca . 

Different theories have been proposed regarding the role of Allah in Meccan religion . 

Many of the physical descriptions of the pre - Islamic gods are traced to idols , especially near the Kaaba , which is said to have contained up to 360 of them . 

Other religions were represented to varying , lesser degrees . 

The influence of the adjacent Roman , Aksumite and Sasanian Empires resulted in Christian communities in the northwest , northeast and south of Arabia . 

Christianity made a lesser impact , but secured some conversions , in the remainder of the peninsula . 

With the exception of Nestorianism in the northeast and the Persian Gulf , the dominant form of Christianity was Miaphysitism . 

The peninsula had been a destination for Jewish migration since Roman times , which had resulted in a diaspora community supplemented by local converts . 

Additionally , the influence of the Sasanian Empire resulted in Iranian religions being present in the peninsula . 

Zoroastrianism existed in the east and south , while there is evidence of Manichaeism or possibly Mazdakism being practised in Mecca .
