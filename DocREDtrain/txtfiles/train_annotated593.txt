The black drongo ( Dicrurus macrocercus ) is a small Asian passerine bird of the drongo family Dicruridae . 

It is a common resident breeder in much of tropical southern Asia from southwest Iran through India and Sri Lanka east to southern China and Indonesia . 

It is a wholly black bird with a distinctive forked tail and measures in length . 

It feeds on insects , and is common in open agricultural areas and light forest throughout its range , perching conspicuously on a bare perch or along power or telephone lines . 

The species is known for its aggressive behaviour towards much larger birds , such as crows , never hesitating to dive - bomb any bird of prey that invades its territory . 

This behaviour earns it the informal name of king crow . 

Smaller birds often nest in the well - guarded vicinity of a nesting black drongo . 

Previously grouped along with the African fork - tailed drongo ( Dicrurus adsimilis ) , the Asian forms are now treated as a separate species with several distinct populations . 

The black drongo has been introduced to some Pacific islands , where it has thrived and become abundant to the point of threatening and causing the extinction of native and endemic bird species there .
