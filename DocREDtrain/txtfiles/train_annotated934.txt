Northam Road is a major thoroughfare along the northern coast of the city of George Town in Penang , Malaysia . 

It continues on from Gurney Drive towards Farquhar Street to the east . 

The road is a one - way road , with the traffic directed eastwards towards Farquhar Street . 

Since the 1990s , Northam Road , along with Gurney Drive , has also emerged as George Town 's second Central Business District . 

In the olden days , the northern coast of George Town was simply known as the ' North Beach ' . 

British administrators , including the founder of Penang , Francis Light , were buried within the Old Protestant Cemetery near the eastern end of Northam Road . 

The road gradually became the address of choice for the Europeans , and later , Chinese tycoons , who built elegant mansions along the road . 

As a result , Northam Road was also known as the Millionaire 's Row by the locals . 

Northam Road is also home to some of the tallest skyscrapers in Penang , many of which house commercial enterprises like banks , insurance firms , property and car dealers , and other businesses .
