Awake is an American television police procedural fantasy drama , created by writer and executive producer Kyle Killen . 

The drama centers on Michael Britten ( Jason Isaacs ) , a detective living in two separate realities after a car accident . 

In one reality , in which he wears a green wrist band , his wife Hannah Britten ( Laura Allen ) was killed in the crash , and in another reality , in which he wears a red wrist band , his son Rex Britten ( Dylan Minnette ) was the one killed . 

Michael does not know which reality is real . 

He sees two separate therapists : Dr. Jonathan Lee ( BD Wong ) in the " red reality " , and Dr. Judith Evans ( Cherry Jones ) in the " green reality " . 

The series was conceived by Killen after creating and developing Lone Star for the Fox network . 

NBC encouraged Killen to conceive a concept for a future television series . 

Although inspired by the processes of dreaming , the script was cited as potentially being too complex for mainstream American television . 

The first episode of Awake was released on Hulu on February 16 , officially premiering in the United States on NBC on March 1 , 2012 . 

On May 11 , NBC canceled the series and aired the final episode on May 24 , 2012 . 

Awake averaged 4.8 million viewers per episode and ranked 125th in viewership for the 2011 â€“ 12 television season . 

Despite its relatively short life span , the series had large support by fans who teamed up to create the " Save Awake " campaign . 

It was well received by television critics based on its storylines . 

" Say Hello to My Little Friend " was generally considered the best episode of the series since the pilot by commentators . 

Various cast members have also been praised by critics , particularly Isaacs ' performance as Michael .
