The Mongol invasion of Europe from the east took place over the course of three centuries , from the Middle Ages to the early modern period . 

The terms Tatars or Tartars are applied to nomadic Mongolic peoples who , themselves , were conquered by Mongols and incorporated into their horde . 

They were mainly composed of Kipchaks - Cuman people . 

Mongol - Tatar Golden Horde forces led by Batu Khan , ( a grandson of Genghis Khan ) , began attacking Europe in 1223 , starting with Cumans , Volga Bulgaria and Kievan Rus . 

They destroyed many Rus cities including Kiev , Vladimir and Moscow in the process , sparing Novgorod and Pskov however . 

They originally planned to continue all the way to the shores of the " Great Sea " ( Atlantic Ocean ) . 

However , upon learning of the death of Ã–gedei Khan ( third son of Genghis Khan , uncle of Batu Khan ) in 1241 they returned eastwards to their steppe homelands . 

This , it could be argued , saved the rest of Europe from suffering the catastrophes that befell the armies and towns of Poland and Hungary , although over - stretched lines of communication and the lack of vast open tracts of pasture land might well have proved the undoing of such a venture .
