William Edward Dodd ( October 21 , 1869 â€“ February 9 , 1940 ) was an American historian , author and diplomat . 

A liberal Democrat , he served as the United States Ambassador to Germany from 1933 to 1937 during the Nazi era . 

Initially a holder of the slightly Antisemitic notions of his times , he went to Germany with instructions from President Franklin D. Roosevelt to do what he could to protest Nazi treatment of Jews in Germany " unofficially , " while also attempting to follow official State Department instructions to maintain cordial official diplomatic relations . 

Convinced from first hand observation that the Nazis were an increasing threat , he resigned over his inability to mobilize the Roosevelt administration , particularly the State Department , to counter the Nazis prior to the start of World War II .
