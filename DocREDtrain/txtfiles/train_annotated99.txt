The National Statuary Hall Collection holds statues donated by each of the United States , depicting notable persons in the histories of the respective states . 

Displayed in the National Statuary Hall and other parts of the United States Capitol in Washington , D.C. , the collection includes two statues from each state , plus one from the District of Columbia , plus Rosa Parks , making a total of 102 . 

By act of Congress , which commissioned the statue in 2005 , Rosa Parks is also there , though not representing a state . 

The year was 2013 , the centenary of her birth . 

Hers is the only statue in the Hall not linked with a state , and the first full - length statue of an African American in the Capitol . 

Later that year ( on Juneteenth , 2013 ) , by act of Congress ( P.L. 

112 - 174 ) , a statue of Frederick Douglass was added as a choice of the District of Columbia .
