" Rammstein " is a song by the German industrial metal band Rammstein . 

It is the eleventh and final track on their debut album , Herzeleid , and was the first song written by the band . 

It is about the Ramstein air show disaster . 

According to an interview with rhythm guitarist Paul Landers , the sound of the main riff of the song is made by him and lead guitarist Richard Kruspe , each playing a similar riff at different octaves ( Richard plays the middle and Paul plays the lower ) . 

The song was featured in the 1997 David Lynch film Lost Highway . 

In the Live aus Berlin performance of the song , lead vocalist Till Lindemann ascends from underneath the stage via a trap door . 

He wears a burning coat , and special goggles from which a laser beam is projected from one of the lenses . 

When they performed the song in the 2004 – 05 Reise , Reise tour , Lindemann no longer wore the flaming jacket , opting instead for dual arm mounted flame throwers . 

Rammstein has been a part of every tour setlist since the song 's inception , including the Pre - Herzeleid years . 

The only tour it has not been included in is the tour for Liebe ist für alle da and Made in Germany 1995–2011 , although in the last Made in Germany tour / unofficial tour name of the Made in Germany tour Wir halten das Tempo tour , the introduction of the song has been used to tease the audience as they performed the intro with guitar flamethrowers before segueing into " Bück Dich " .
