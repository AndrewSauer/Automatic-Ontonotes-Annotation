L.A. Woman is the sixth studio album by the American rock band the Doors , released on April 19 , 1971 , on Elektra Records . 

It is the last to feature the group 's lead singer , Jim Morrison , who died three months after the album 's release . 

It saw the band continue to integrate elements of blues back into their music , a direction begun with their previous album , Morrison Hotel . 

It was also recorded without record producer Paul A. Rothchild after he fell out with the group over the perceived lack of quality of their studio performances . 

Subsequently , the band co - produced the album with longtime sound engineer Bruce Botnick . 

" Love Her Madly " was released as a single in March 1971 , preceding the album 's release , and it reached the Top 20 in the Billboard Hot 100 . 

Upon release , the album peaked at number nine on the Billboard 200 and reached number 28 on the UK Albums Charts . 

An additional single in support of the album , " Riders on the Storm " , also achieved chart success on Billboard and in the UK . 

Critics Richie Unterberger and David Quantick have both called L.A. Woman one of the Doors ' best albums , citing Morrison 's unwavering enthusiasm in his vocal performance , and the band 's stripped - down return to their blues rock roots .
