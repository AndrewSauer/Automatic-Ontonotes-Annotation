Slava ( " Glory " ) was a pre - dreadnought battleship of the Imperial Russian Navy , the last of the five s. Commissioned too late to participate in the Battle of Tsushima during the Russo - Japanese War , she survived while all of her sister ships were either sunk during the battle or surrendered to the Imperial Japanese Navy . 

Serving in the Baltic Sea during World War I , Slava was the largest ship of the Russian Gulf of Riga Squadron that fought the German High Seas Fleet in the Battle of the Gulf of Riga in August 1915 . 

She repeatedly bombarded German positions and troops for the rest of 1915 and during 1916 . 

During the Battle of Moon Sound in 1917 , Slava was badly damaged by the German dreadnought , significantly increasing her draft . 

The shallow channel made it impossible to escape and she was scuttled in the Moon Sound Strait between the island of Muhu ( Moon ) and the mainland . 

The Estonians scrapped her during the 1930s .
