Ultimo mondo cannibale ( English : Last Cannibal World ; also known as Cannibal The Last Survivor and Jungle Holocaust ) is a 1977 Italian cannibal exploitation film directed by Ruggero Deodato . 

The film stars Massimo Foschi , Me Me Lai and Ivan Rassimov . 

The screenplay was written by Tito Carpi , Gianfranco Clerici and Renzo Genta , and tells the story of a man trying to escape from a jungle island inhabited by a native cannibal tribe . 

It is the precursor to Deodato 's notoriously controversial Cannibal Holocaust ( 1980 ) , but was originally slated to be directed by Umberto Lenzi as a follow - up to his prototypical 1972 cannibal film Man from Deep River . 

While not prosecuted for obscenity , the film was seized and confiscated in the UK under Section 3 of the Obscene Publications Act 1959 during the video nasty panic .
