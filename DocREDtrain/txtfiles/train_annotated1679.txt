The history of Egypt under Gamal Abdel Nasser covers the period of Egyptian history from the Egyptian revolution of 1952 , of which Gamal Abdel Nasser was one of the two principal leaders , spanning Nasser 's presidency of Egypt from 1956 , to his death in 1970 . 

Nasser 's tenure as Egypt 's leader heralded a new period of modernisation and socialist reform in Egypt and a staunch advocacy of pan - Arab nationalism ( including a short - lived union with Syria ) and developing world solidarity . 

His prestige in Egypt and throughout the Arab world soared in the wake of his nationalisation of the Suez Canal in 1956 , and Egypt 's political victory in the subsequent Tripartite Aggression , but was damaged badly by Israel 's successful invasion and occupation of Egyptian and Arab territory in the Six - Day War of 1967 . 

The era is regarded as a time where ordinary citizens enjoyed unprecedented access to housing , education , jobs , health services and nourishment as well as other forms of social welfare , while aristocratic influence waned . 

The national economy grew significantly through agrarian reform , major modernisation projects such as the Helwan steel works and the Aswan Dam and nationalisation schemes such as that of the Suez Canal . 

However , the substantial economic growth that marked the early 1960s took a downturn for the remainder of the decade , only recovering in 1970 . 

During Nasser 's time in office , Egypt experienced a golden age of culture , particularly in theater , film , poetry , television , radio , literature , fine arts , comedy and music . 

Egypt under Nasser dominated the Arab world in these fields , producing singers such as Abdel Halim Hafez , Umm Kulthum and Mohammed Abdel Wahab , literary figures such as Naguib Mahfouz and Tawfiq el - Hakim , actors like Faten Hamama and Rushdi Abaza and the release of over 100 films yearly , compared to the production of just more than a dozen annually during Hosni Mubarak 's presidency ( 1981 â€“ 2011 ) .
