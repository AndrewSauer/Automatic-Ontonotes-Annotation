" One weekend a month , two weeks a year " is a former recruiting slogan used by the U.S. Army National Guard . 

It indicated the amount of time an individual would need to spend actively in the Guard to be a Guardsman with benefits . 

Though never officially , it was also informally used by Air National Guard , U.S. Army Reserve , U.S. 

Naval Reserve , U.S. Marine Corps Reserve , U.S. Air Force Reserve and U.S. Coast Guard Reserve personnel in describing their similar military time commitment . 

It was dropped during the Iraq War after it became clear that National Guardsmen and Reservists were now serving considerably more time in service , especially on active military duty on extended overseas deployments in the Southwest Asia combat zone .
