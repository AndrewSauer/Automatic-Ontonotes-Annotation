Everard des Barres ( also Eberhard von Barres or Eberhard De BÃ¤ren ) ( died 1174 ) was the third Grand Master of the Knights Templar from 1147 to 1151 . 

As Preceptor of the Templars in France from 1143 , he was one of the highest dignitaries of the Order when Robert de Craon died in 1147 . 

He was chosen to succeed Robert , and as soon as he was elected , he accompanied Louis VII of France on the Second Crusade , and was among those sent ahead to Constantinople before Louis ' arrival there . 

He later saved Louis during a battle with the Seljuk Turks in Pisidia . 

According to the chronicler Odo of Deuil , Everard was extremely pious and valiant . 

He seems to have had a strong influence on Louis . 

After the failure of the crusade at the Siege of Damascus in 1148 , Louis returned to France , followed by Everard , who was in charge of the king 's treasury . 

Everard 's Templars stayed behind and helped defend Jerusalem against a Turkish raid in 1149 . 

Back in France , Everard abdicated officially in 1151 and became a monk at Clairvaux , despite the protests of the Templars . 

He was succeeded by Bernard de Tremelay ( who actually led the Order since Everard 's departure in 1149 ) and died in 1174 .
