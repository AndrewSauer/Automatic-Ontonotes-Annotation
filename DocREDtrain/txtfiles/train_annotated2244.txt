The Jakarta International Film Festival ( JIFFEST ) is the major film festival of Indonesia held every December in the capital , Jakarta , since 1999 . 

The number of Indonesian films shown at the festival had grown from four in 1999 to around 100 by 2009 . 

Since 2006 , JIFFEST has hosted an Indonesian Feature Film Competition with foreign film professionals acting as juries . 

JIFFEST 's script development competition and workshop winners include Wahyu Aditya ( 2004 ) , World Champion International Young Creative Entrepreneur of the Year ( 2007 ) ; Tumpal Tampubolon ( 2005 ) , Asian Young Filmmakers Fellow Korea ( 2008 ) ; Salman Aristo ( 2006 ) , writer of Ayat - Ayat Cinta ( 2007 ) , Laskar Pelangi ( 2008 ) , and Garuda di Dadaku ( 2009 ) ; Yuli Andari Merdekaningtyas ( 2006 ) , and director of Suster Apung , winner of Eagle Awards Metro TV ( 2006 ) . 

The festival is on a shaky financial footing and is hoping to continue by switching its funding source from foreign donors to government grants and private donations .
