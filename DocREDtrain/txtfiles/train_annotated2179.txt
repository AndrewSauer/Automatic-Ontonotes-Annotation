Dawuntna Delant ( " Dewunt and Delant " ) was one of the 105 woredas in the Amhara Region of Ethiopia . 

Part of the Semien Wollo Zone , Dawuntna Delant was bordered on the south by the Checheho River which separated it from the Debub Wollo Zone , on the west by the Debub Gondar Zone , on the north by Wadla , and on the east by Guba Lafto . 

The deep valley of the Zhit'a river , which runs through Wadla and along part of the northern border , effectively isolates much of Dawuntna Delant from the rest of Semien Wollo . 

This woreda was named after two historical districts , Dawunt to the east and Delanta to the west . 

The major town in Dawuntna Delant was Wegeltena . 

This woreda was separated for Dawunt and Delanta woredas .
