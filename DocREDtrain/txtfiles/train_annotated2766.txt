Mesonauta , the flag cichlids , is a small genus of cichlids native to the Amazon , Orinoco , Essequibo , Paran√° and Paraguay basins in South America . 

Mesonauta is included in the subfamily Cichlasomatinae . 

They occur in various freshwater habitats such as streams and lakes , especially in areas with little water movement and aquatic vegetation . 

They are generally found in small groups that stay near the water surface . 

To avoid predators , adults may jump out of the water and juveniles mimic leaves . 

Some species are popular in the fishkeeping hobby and are frequently kept in aquariums . 

These have traditionally been referred to as M. festivus , but following taxonomic reviews of the genus in 1991 and 1998 , the species most often seen in the aquarium trade are M. guyanae , M. insignis and M. mirificus . 

The species are similar in general appearance , but they have different distributions and can be separated by the bars they show on the body when stressed or excited ( very faint when relaxed ) .
