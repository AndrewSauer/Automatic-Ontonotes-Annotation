Sweet Savage are a heavy metal band from Belfast , Northern Ireland , formed in 1979 . 

The band once included former Dio and Def Leppard guitarist Vivian Campbell . 

Since forming in 1979 , Sweet Savage have released three studio albums , three singles and one demo . 

Considered one of the pioneers of the new wave of British heavy metal movement alongside acts such as Iron Maiden , Saxon , Diamond Head , and Def Leppard . 

However , even though they were often considered among the forerunners of the NWOBHM movement , success eluded them and they disbanded shortly after 1982 . 

The band reformed in 1984 with a different line - up , but did not last long . 

Sweet Savage was once again reformed in the 90s , due to Metallica covering their song " Killing Time " as a B - side for their " The Unforgiven " single . 

Sweet Savage released a new studio album , entitled Regeneration , in May 2011 .
