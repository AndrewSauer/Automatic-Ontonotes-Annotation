Thurrock Independents is a group of British politicians in Thurrock , Essex that was formed after its members broke away from the UK Independence Party ( UKIP ) in January 2018 . 

The group has seventeen members , including former UKIP MEP Tim Aker , and forms the opposition group on Thurrock Council . 

The group was created after all seventeen members of the council 's UKIP group left the party , saying they had " had enough of the aggressive and bitter reality of party politics " . 

Although Tim Aker joined his council colleagues in the new group , he subsequently stated that he would continue to represent UKIP in the European Parliament for the purposes of Brexit : " UKIP has a job to do in the European Parliament in seeing we get the Brexit we voted for . 

I will stay as a UKIP MEP . 

But to better represent my constituents in Aveley , I had no choice but to follow my colleagues and represent the Thurrock Independents . " 

This situation led to some uncertainty about the status of some of the group 's members as a number of them work for Aker .
