The Road to Ruin is a 1970 album released by husband and wife John and Beverley Martyn . 

It was the second ( and last ) album released as a duo . 

Island Records persuaded John Martyn to resume his solo career as they believed that the public was more interested in John as a solo artist rather than as part of a duo . 

The album marked the first collaboration on record between John and bassist Danny Thompson , who featured on many of Martyn 's subsequent recordings . 

The album 's first track " Primrose Hill " written and sung by Beverley Martyn , and featuring Ray Warleigh on saxophone , about the simple joys of domesticity , was extensively sampled by Fatboy Slim for the track " North West Three " from his 2004 album Palookaville .
