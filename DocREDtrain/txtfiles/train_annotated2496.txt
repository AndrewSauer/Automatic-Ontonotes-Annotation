The Le Blon was a French automobile manufactured in Paris by Le Blon Frères in 1898 or from 1898 - 1900 . 

It was a voiturette similar to the Benz , with a 4   hp ' V ' twin - cylinder engine and belt drive to the rear axle . 

Some cars were sold in England under the name " Lynx " . 

Le Blon Frères was based at ( Maus , de la Forêt ) , 56 , rue du Vieux Pont de Sèvres , Boulogne - Billancourt . 

It is possible that 23-year - old pioneer motorist Hubert Le Blon was one of the brothers . 

After the Le Blon Frères business closed ( 1899 - 1900 ) he started to work with Léon Serpollet whose factory in the 18th arrondissement was about 10   km away . 

Le Blon competed in the Gardner - Serpollet steam car from 1901 onwards .
