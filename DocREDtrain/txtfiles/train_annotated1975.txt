The National Palace is a palace in Addis Ababa , Ethiopia . 

It is also known as the Jubilee Palace . 

The palace was built in 1955 to mark the Silver Jubilee of His Imperial Majesty Emperor Haile Selassie . 

After a coup attempt in the Guenete Leul Palace in 1960 , the Emperor made the Jubilee Palace his main residence . 

However , the seat of government remained at the Imperial Palace . 

The palace was expanded and doubled in size between 1966 and 1967 . 

The Jubilee Palace was the site of the dethronement of Emperor Haile Selassie in September 1974 . 

Ten low ranking military officers appeared before the Emperor in the palace library and read him the statement of the Derg ( military council ) , which officially removed him from the throne . 

The Derg renamed the Palace the " National Palace " , which it still bears today . 

The Derg used this Palace for state ceremonies involving visiting heads of state , state banquets and receptions . 

The Derg added a swimming pool to the grounds . 

With the fall of the Derg , and the proclamation of the Federal Republic , the Jubilee Palace became the official residence of the President of the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia . 

The President has a ceremonial role and uses the palace for official functions . 

The Ethiopian Government has announced its intention to build a new official presidential residence . 

The National Palace will then be opened as a museum . 

It will continue to house the President of the Republic until that time .
