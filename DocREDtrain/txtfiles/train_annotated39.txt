The Elbe Lateral Canal (; ) , is a long canal in Lower Saxony , Germany . 

It runs from the Mittelland Canal near Gifhorn to the Elbe in Artlenburg . 

It forms an important transport connection between southern and northern Germany , and it provides a bypass of a section of the Elbe with limited navigability . 

At the construction start it was also thought as a bypass outside the GDR , considered politically unreliable . 

Construction of the Elbe Lateral Canal was started in 1968 , and the canal was opened in June 1976 . 

Due to a dam rupture , it was closed from July 1976 until June 1977 . 

The difference in elevation between the Mitteland Canal and the Elbe is , which is overcome by a lock at Uelzen and the Scharnebeck twin ship lift , a boat lift at Scharnebeck . 

There are small ports along the canal in Lüneburg , Uelzen and Wittingen , and a landing stage at Wulfstorf ( near Bienenbüttel ) .
