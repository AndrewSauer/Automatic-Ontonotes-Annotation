Pietro Paolo Bonzi ( c. 1576 - 1636 ) , also known as il Gobbo dei Carracci ( hunchback of the Carracci ) or il Gobbo dei Frutti ( of fruits ) , was an Italian painter , best known for his landscapes and still - lifes . 

A cartoon of the painter shows his highly deformed lordotic posture . 

He was born in Cortona , was part of the circle of Annibale Carracci and Domenichino , and trained under Giovanni Battista Viola in Rome . 

In Rome , he worked for Cardinal Pier Paolo Crescenzi . 

There are only two still - life paintings known with his signature ; he thus was one of the first Italian artists in Rome working in this style . 

The Giustiniani inventories of 1638 cite paintings by Bonzi , and other still - lifes are documented in the 1670 inventory of Principe Lorenzo Onofrio Colonna 's collection . 

He also worked in fresco and in 1622 - 23 worked with Pietro da Cortona on the ceiling of a gallery in the Palazzo Mattei di Giove . 

Other commissions cited by Baglione include his work in the Palazzo Pallavicini - Rospigliosi .
