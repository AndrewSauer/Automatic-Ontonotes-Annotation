The geology of Zimbabwe in southern Africa is centred on the Zimbabwe Craton , a core of Archean basement composed in the main of granitoids , schist and gneisses . 

It also incorporates greenstone belts comprising mafic , ultramafic and felsic volcanics which are associated with epiclastic sediments and iron formations . 

The craton is overlain in the north , northwest and east by Proterozoic and Phanerozoic sedimentary basins whilst to the northwest are the rocks of the Magondi Supergroup . 

Northwards is the Zambezi Belt and to the east the Mozambique Belt . 

South of the Zimbabwe Craton is the Kaapval Craton separated from it by the Limpopo Mobile Belt , a zone of deformation and metamorphism reflecting geological events from Archean to Mesoproterozoic times . 

The Zimbabwe Craton is intruded by an elongate ultramafic / mafic igneous complex known as the Great Dyke which runs for more than 500 Â  km along a SSW / NNE oriented graben . 

It consists of peridotites , pyroxenites , norites and bands of chromitite .
