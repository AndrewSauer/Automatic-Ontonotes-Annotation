" Occhi di ragazza " ( " Girl 's eyes " ) was the Italian entry in the Eurovision Song Contest 1970 , performed in Italian by Gianni Morandi . 

The song is a ballad , with Morandi musing on the power of his lover 's eyes . 

Initially , he describes them as windows into her soul and places where he can see their future . 

The song ends , however , on something of a pessimistic note , as he explains that these same eyes will one day fill with tears as their relationship ends . 

The song was performed third on the night , following Switzerland 's Henri Dès with " Retour " and preceding Yugoslavia 's Eva Sršen with " Pridi , dala ti bom cvet " . 

At the close of voting , it had received 5 points , placing it 8th in a field of 12 . 

It was succeeded as Italian representative at the 1971 Contest by Massimo Ranieri with " L'amore è un attimo " .
