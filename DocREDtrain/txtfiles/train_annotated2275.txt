" Clyde Bruckman 's Final Repose " is the fourth episode of the third season of the American science fiction television series The X - Files . 

Directed by David Nutter and written by Darin Morgan , the installment serves as a " Monster - of - the - Week " story — a stand - alone plot unconnected to the overarching mythology of The X - Files . 

Originally aired by the Fox network on October 13 , 1995 , " Clyde Bruckman 's Final Repose " received a Nielsen rating of 10.2 and was seen by 15.38 million viewers . 

The episode received critical acclaim , and several writers named it among the best in the series . 

The episode won both an Emmy for Outstanding Writing in a Drama Series as well as an Emmy for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Drama Series . 

The show centers on FBI special agents Fox Mulder ( David Duchovny ) and Dana Scully ( Gillian Anderson ) who work on cases linked to the paranormal , called X - Files . 

Mulder is a believer in the abnormal ; the skeptical Scully has been assigned to debunk his work , but the two have developed a deep friendship . 

In this episode , Mulder and Scully investigate a series of murders of psychics and fortune tellers . 

The two are assisted by Clyde Bruckman ( Peter Boyle ) , an enigmatic and reluctant individual who possesses the ability to foresee how people are going to die . 

Morgan wished to write an episode of The X - Files wherein one of the characters commits suicide at the end . 

Although Morgan was initially afraid to add humor to his script , he created a compromise by making the episode as dark as possible . 

Several of the characters ' names are references to silent film - era actors and screenwriters . 

Notably , the episode features a prediction by Bruckman — that Agent Scully will not die — that is later bookended by the sixth season episode " Tithonus . "
