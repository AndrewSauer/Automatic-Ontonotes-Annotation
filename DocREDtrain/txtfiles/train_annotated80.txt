Canine leishmaniasis ( LEESH - ma - NIGH - ah - sis ) is a zoonotic disease ( see human leishmaniasis ) caused by Leishmania parasites transmitted by the bite of an infected phlebotomine sandfly . 

Canine leishmaniasis was first identified in Europe in 1903 , and in 1940 , 40 % of all dogs in Rome were determined to be positive for leishmaniasis . 

Traditionally thought of as a disease only found near the Mediterranean basin , 2008 research claims new findings are evidence that canine leishmaniasis is currently expanding in continental climate areas of northwestern Italy , far from the recognized disease - endemic areas along the Mediterranean coasts . 

Cases of leishmaniasis began appearing in North America in 2000 , and , as of 2008 , Leishmania - positive foxhounds have been reported in 22 U.S. states and two Canadian provinces .
