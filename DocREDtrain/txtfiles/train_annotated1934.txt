Duets II is the 59th and last studio album by American singer Frank Sinatra . 

It was released in 1994 , and was the sequel to the previous year 's Duets . 

Phil Ramone produced the album and guest artists from various genres contributed their duet parts to Sinatra 's already recorded vocals . 

Though not as commercially successful as Duets , it still rose to # 9 on the Billboard albums chart and sold over 1 million copies in the U.S. 

It also peaked at # 29 in the UK . 

Critical notices were again mixed at best , although some viewed it as an improvement over its predecessor . 

However , the album won Sinatra the 1995 Grammy Award for Best Traditional Pop Vocal Performance , his last competitive Grammy Award . 

These would be the last studio recordings made by Sinatra , who had begun his recording career fifty five years earlier . 

Both were packaged together in a " 90th Birthday Limited Collector 's Edition " released in 2005 ; North American pressings add an unreleased duet recording of " My Way " with Willie Nelson , while international pressings have him singing with Luciano Pavarotti .
