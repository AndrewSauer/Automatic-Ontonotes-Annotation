The Rankenian Club was an 18th - century society of intellectuals , founded in 1716 or earlier and disbanded some time after 1760 . 

It is regarded as the most important of the many learned clubs and societies which were an important feature of the Scottish Enlightenment . 

The Scots Magazine in May 1771 reckoned that " the Rankenians were highly instrumental in disseminating throughout Scotland freedom of thought , boldness of disquisition , liberality of sentiment , accuracy of reasoning , correctness of taste and accuracy of composition . " 

Its members were to become major figures of the Scottish Enlightenment including : Charles Mackie ( 1688 - 1770 ) , later the first professor of history at the University of Edinburgh ; John Stevenson ( 1695 - 1775 ) , later professor of logic and rhetoric ; George Turnbull ( 1698 - 1748 ) , theologian and professor of moral philosophy at Marischal College , Aberdeen ; Robert Wallace ( 1697 - 1771 ) , theologian and population scientist ; William Wishart ( 1691 - 1753 ) , leading church minister and principal of the University of Edinburgh and Colin MacLaurin ( 1698 - 1746 ) , philosopher and the greatest Scottish mathematician of his day . 

Another of the group 's members was the surgeon and philosopher George Young ( 1692 - 1757 ) , the only surgeon known to have joined .
