Lucius Caesar ( Latin : Lucius Julius Caesar ; 17 BC â€“ 20 August AD 2 ) was the grandson of Augustus . 

The son of Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa and Julia the Elder , Augustus ' only daughter , Lucius was adopted by his grandfather along with his older brother , Gaius Caesar . 

As the emperor 's adopted sons and joint - heirs to the Roman Empire , Lucius and Gaius had promising political and military careers . 

However , Lucius died of a sudden illness on 20 August AD 2 , in Massilia , Gaul , while traveling to meet the Roman army in Hispania . 

His brother Gaius also died at a relatively young age on 21 February , AD 4 . 

The untimely loss of both heirs compelled Augustus to redraw the line of succession by adopting Lucius ' younger brother , Agrippa Postumus as well as his stepson , Tiberius on 26 June AD 4 .
