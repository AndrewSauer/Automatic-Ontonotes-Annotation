The Zhangping – Quanzhou – Xiaocuo railway ( ) , also known as the Zhangquanxiao railway , is a regional railway in Fujian Province , China . 

The line runs eastward from Zhangping , in the interior , to Quanzhou , on the coast , and terminates at the Xiaocuo Harbor in the Port of Quanzhou . 

Construction began in 1958 and the Zhangping - Quanzhou section entered operation in 2001 . 

The extension to Xiaochuo Harbor was built in 2007 . 

The Zhangping – Quanzhou section of the rail line used to have fairly active passenger service , with a number of fairly slow trains connecting Quanzhou East railway station with major cities throughout China . 

Passenger service on this line was terminated , and Quanzhou East railway station closed on December 9 , 2014 , presumably as a consequence of the introduction of much faster high - speed service on the Fuzhou – Xiamen railway and connecting lines .
