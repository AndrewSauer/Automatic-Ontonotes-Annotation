Verbena , also known as Summerfield , is an unincorporated community in southeastern Chilton County , Alabama , United States . 

Named for the indigenous flower , Verbena developed into a popular resort location for the more affluent citizenry of Montgomery , the state 's capital , during the yellow fever outbreaks of the late 19th and early 20th centuries . 

Many stately homes , some of which have undergone recent renovation and restoration , line the streets of the town as a reminder of this historic past . 

The town was built beside the railroad currently owned by CSX Transportation . 

In its heyday , Verbena had two hotels , a bank , a post office , and a general store . 

Many of those buildings are gone or boarded up today , but the Verbena United Methodist Church still stands on County Road 59 near the town 's center . 

According to the U.S. Census in 1890 , Verbena showed a population of 756 , making it the largest community in Chilton County at that time .
