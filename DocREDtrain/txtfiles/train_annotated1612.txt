Shree Teen Maharaja Sir Jung Bahadur Kunwar Ranaji , ( born as Bir Narsingh Kunwar ( ) , 18 June 1817 , Borlang , Gorkha â€“ 25 February 1877 , Patharghat , Rautahat ; popularly known as Jung Bahadur Rana ( ) ) was a Khas Rajput ( Chhetri ) ruler of Nepal and founder of the Rana of Nepal . 

His real name was Bir Narsingh Kunwar but he became famous by the name Junga Bahadur , given to him by first Prime Minister and C - in - C Mathabar Singh Thapa , his maternal uncle . 

His mother Ganesh Kumari was the daughter of Kaji Nain Singh Thapa , brother of PM Bhimsen Thapa of then ruling Thapa . 

Through the influence of his maternal side , he enjoyed privileges . 

During his lifetime , he eliminated the factional fighting at the court , removed his family rivals such as Pandes and Basnyats and paved way for the finding of Rana , introduced innovations into the bureaucracy and the judiciary , and made efforts to " modernize " Nepal . 

He remains one of the most important figures in Nepalese history , though modern historians have also blamed Jung Bahadur for setting up the dictatorship that repressed the nation for 104 years from 1846 to 1951 and left it in a primitive economic condition . 

Others exclusively blame his nephews , the Shumsher Ranas , for Nepal 's dark period of history . 

Rana rule was marked by tyranny , debauchery , economic exploitation and religious persecution .
