Best Wishes is the second album by New York hardcore band , Cro - Mags . 

It was released on April 26 , 1989 on Profile Records and was subsequently re - released on Another Planet â€“ along with their debut album , The Age Of Quarrel , on the same disc . 

The album 's cover reflected the band 's interest in the Hare Krishna religion which started with previous singer John Joseph and then carried on through Harley Flanagan who also became a devotee . 

The Krishna faith was ultimately the demise of the band , as the contradiction of a faith of pacifism against the violence of the band 's music was often even too much for the band members to handle . 

However , before this , in 1992 , their next album , Alpha Omega , saw the return of John Joseph to the Cro - Mags fold , and an even further gravitation towards a metal sound .
