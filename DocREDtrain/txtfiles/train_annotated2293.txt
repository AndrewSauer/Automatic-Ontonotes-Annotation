Cianjur is a town and district in the West Java province of Indonesia , and is the capital of Cianjur Regency . 

The town of Cianjur is located along one of the main roads between Jakarta ( 120   km to the northwest ) and Bandung ( 60   km to the east ) . 

The population was 158,125 at the 2010 Census . 

Because of its location , some of Cianjur 's residents commute to work either in Bandung or in Jakarta . 

The road on which Cianjur is located used to be the main ( extremely busy ) road from Jakarta to Bandung but was in effect replaced as the main road link between these two main cities when the Jakarta - Bandung tollroad was fully completed in 2005 . 

Cianjur was founded in 1677 , with the first head of the town being R. A. Wiratanudatar I , entitled Dalem Cikundul , as the descendant from the old Sundanese kingdom of Pajajaran . 

The district mainly produces agricultural products , especially rice , and it has been known as the major source of rice production for the heavily populated Java island besides Karawang . 

More than 75 people were killed in the earthquake of 2 September 2009 .
