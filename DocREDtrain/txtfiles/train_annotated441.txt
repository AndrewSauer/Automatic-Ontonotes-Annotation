In early 2006 , a furore erupted in Indonesia over the Australian government 's decision to grant temporary protection visas to 42 West Papuan asylum seekers . 

The controversy caused diplomatic tension as well as a " war of cartoons " , with newspapers in Indonesia and Australia trading hits over a decision that the Indonesians say questions the sovereignty that they officially have over West Papua . 

The issue was caused by the Australian Government 's decision through the immigration department to allow visas to 42 refugees that arrived in January . 

Part of the Indonesian concern is based on the speed at which these asylum seekers were processed â€“ forty - two were processed in just two months , with the remaining asylum seeker having been approved in mid - April . 

The Indonesian government took the move as a direct challenge , inferring that the approval of the temporary protection visas indicated that the Australian Governmnent agreed with the West Papuans that they face persecution if they returned home .
