Viva Macau Airlines was a Macanese long - haul , low - cost carrier based at Macau International Airport . 

The airline operated flights to Australia and Asia . 

In March 2010 , Viva Macau was forced to suspend operations after the Macau government suddenly ordered Air Macau to cancel its sub - concession agreement with Viva Macau , alleging that Viva Macau failed to adequately assist passengers affected by flight delays and cancellations . 

The government then quickly revoked Viva Macau 's Air Operator 's Certificate saying that without a sub - concession , the airline was not compliant with the requirements for public air transport services . 

The action is currently under appeal in the Macau courts and has raised questions for foreign investors regarding Macau 's regulatory environment .
