Eijsden railway station ( Edn ) is the railway station of Eijsden , Limburg , the Netherlands . 

The station , which is the southernmost railway station in the Netherlands , opened on November 24 , 1861 , and was closed between December 10 , 2006 and December 11 , 2011 . 

The railway station is located on the railway line between Liège - Guillemins ( Belgium ) and Maastricht ( Netherlands ) . 

Only trains of the National Railway Company of Belgium between the two stations call in Eijsden ; Nederlandse Spoorwegen trains do n't serve the station . 

When the National Railway Company of Belgium extended the InterCity line between Brussels - South and Liège - Guillemins to Maastricht , the regular local service between Liège - Guillemins and Maastricht was halted . 

The InterCity trains were too long to halt in Eijsden , so the railway station was closed . 

A new busline was opened between Maastricht and the railway station in Visé ( Belgium ) to serve Eijsden . 

After the closure of the railway station , citizens of Eijsden formed the committee " Trein Terug In Eijsden " ( Return the Train To Eijsden ) , which aims to reopen the railway station . 

The fact that overhead lines at the railway station carry 3kV direct current , like the Belgian railway network , whereas the Dutch railway network carries 1.5kV. 

Regular Dutch electric trains are not able to reach Eijsden , unless they are multi - system units . 

As of December 11 , 2011 Eijsden is again been serviced by Belgian trains thus reopening the station after a 5-year closure .
