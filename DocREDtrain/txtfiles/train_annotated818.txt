The Battle of Kansas ( also known as the " Battle of Wichita " ) was the nickname given to a project to build , modify , and deliver large quantities of the world 's most advanced bomber to the front - lines , originally in Europe and in the Pacific , although due to delay in production , was only used in the Pacific . 

The battle began as the first B-29 Superfortresses rolled off the production lines of the massive new Boeing factory on the prairies near Wichita , Kansas . 

The Boeing B-29 Superfortress was a quantum leap in aviation technology which unfortunately came with a lion 's share of problems to be resolved before it was committed to combat operations . 

When the B-29 was ordered into production , Pearl Harbor had n't even happened yet and the first flight of the XB-29 prototype was still over a year away . 

On 6 September 1941 the US Army Air Corps ( soon to be the US Army Air Forces ) placed its initial production contract for 250 B-29s , built mainly in Wichita , KS .
