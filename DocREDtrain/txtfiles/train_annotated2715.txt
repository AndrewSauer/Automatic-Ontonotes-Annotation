The Committee of Public Safety ( ) , created in April 1793 by the National Convention and then restructured in July 1793 , formed the de facto executive government in France during the Reign of Terror ( 1793 – 1794 ) , a stage of the French Revolution . 

The Committee of Public Safety succeeded the previous Committee of General Defence ( established in January 1793 ) and assumed its role of protecting the newly established republic against foreign attacks and internal rebellion . 

As a wartime measure , the Committee — composed at first of nine and later of twelve members — was given broad supervisory powers over military , judicial and legislative efforts . 

It was formed as an administrative body to supervise and expedite the work of the executive bodies of the Convention and of the government ministers appointed by the Convention . 

As the Committee tried to meet the dangers of a coalition of European nations and counter - revolutionary forces within the country , it became more and more powerful . 

Following the defeat at the Convention of the Girondins in July 1793 , a prominent Jacobin identified as a radical , Maximilien Robespierre , was added to the Committee . 

The power of the Committee peaked between August 1793 and July 1794 . 

In December 1793 , the Convention formally conferred executive power upon the Committee . 

The execution of Robespierre in July 1794 represented a reactionary period against the Committee of Public Safety . 

This became known as the Thermidorian Reaction , as Robespierre 's fall from power occurred during the month of Thermidor in the French Republican calendar . 

The Committee 's influence diminished and it was abolished in 1795 .
