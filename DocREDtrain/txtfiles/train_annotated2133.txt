Tajik or Tajiki ( Tajik : забо́ни тоҷикӣ́ , zaboni tojikī ) , also called Tajiki Persian ( Tajik : форси́и тоҷикӣ́ , forsii tojikī , ) , is the variety of Persian spoken in Tajikistan and Uzbekistan . 

It is closely related to Dari Persian . 

Since the beginning of the twentieth century and collapse of the Soviet Union , Tajik has been considered by a number of writers and researchers to be a variety of Persian ( Halimov 1974 : 30–31 , Oafforov 1979 : 33 ) . 

The popularity of this conception of Tajik as a variety of Persian was such that , during the period in which Tajik intellectuals were trying to establish Tajik as a language separate from Persian , Sadriddin Ayni , who was a prominent intellectual and educator , had to make a statement that Tajik was not a bastardized dialect of Persian . 

The issue of whether Tajik and Persian are to be considered two dialects of a single language or two discrete languages has political sides to it ( see Perry 1996 ) . 

Today Tajik is recognized as a dialect of the Persian language . 

Tajik is the official language of Tajikistan . 

In Afghanistan ( where Tajik people make up a large part of the population ) , this language is less influenced by Turkic languages , is called Dari , and has co - official language status . 

Tajik has diverged from Persian as spoken in Afghanistan and Iran due to political borders , geographical isolation , the standardization process , and the influence of Russian and neighboring Turkic languages . 

The standard language is based on the northwestern dialects of Tajik ( region of old major city of Samarqand ) , which have been somewhat influenced by the neighboring Uzbek language as a result of geographical proximity . 

Tajik also retains numerous archaic elements in its vocabulary , pronunciation , and grammar that have been lost elsewhere in the Persophone world , in part due to its relative isolation in the mountains of Central Asia .
