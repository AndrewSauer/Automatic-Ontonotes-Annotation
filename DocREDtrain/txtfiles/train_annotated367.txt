Stahlmusik is the debut album of the German Industrial band Einstürzende Neubauten . 

One of the earliest and rarest Neubauten albums , Stahlmusik was recorded live - to - tape in a pillar of the Stadtautobahn Bridge in West Berlin on June 1 , 1980 , and was released on cassette in October via Blixa Bargeld 's " Eisengrau " shop , where the earliest incarnations of the band would often rehearse . 

Musically , the sound of the album is more conventional than the band 's next album , Kollaps , mainly because of percussionist N.U. 

Unruh had not yet abandoned his drum - kit for the miscellaneous scrap metal of later releases ; The songs are more akin to the material on the double 7 " Schwarz , released prior to Kollaps but nearly a year after Stahlmusik , in particular , the EP 's title track . 

A version of " Für den Untergang " from these sessions appeared as " Stahlversion " on the B - side of the Für den Untergang 7 " , and was later reissued on Strategies Against Architecture 80 - 83 .
