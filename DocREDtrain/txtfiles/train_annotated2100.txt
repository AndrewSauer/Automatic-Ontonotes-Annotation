Australia 's involvement in the Vietnam War began with a small commitment of 30 military advisors in 1962 , and increased over the following decade to a peak of 7,672 Australian personnel following the Menzies Government 's April 1965 decision to upgrade its military commitment to South Vietnam 's security . 

By the time the last Australian personnel were withdrawn in 1972 , the Vietnam War had become Australia 's longest war , and was only recently surpassed by Australia 's long term commitment of combat forces to the War in Afghanistan . 

It remains Australia 's largest force contribution to a foreign conflict since the Second World War and was also the most controversial in Australian society since the conscription controversy during the First World War . 

Although initially enjoying broad support due to concerns about the spread of communism in Southeast Asia , a vocal anti - war movement developed in response to Australia 's programme of conscription . 

The withdrawal of Australia 's forces from South Vietnam began in November 1970 , under the Gorton Government , when 8 RAR completed its tour of duty and was not replaced . 

A phased withdrawal followed , and by 11 January 1973 Australian involvement in hostilities in Vietnam had ceased . 

Nevertheless , Australian troops from the Australian Embassy Platoon remained deployed in the country until 1 July 1973 , and Australian forces were deployed briefly in April 1975 , during the Fall of Saigon , to evacuate personnel from the Australian embassy . 

Approximately 60,000 Australians served in the war ; 521 were killed and more than 3,000 were wounded .
