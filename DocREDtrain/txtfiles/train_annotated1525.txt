The De Legibus ( On the Laws ) is a dialogue written by Marcus Tullius Cicero during the last years of the Roman Republic . 

It bears the same name as Plato â€™s famous dialogue , The Laws . 

Unlike his previous work de re publica , in which Cicero felt compelled to set the action in the times of Scipio Africanus Minor , Cicero wrote this work as a fictionalized dialogue between himself , his brother Quintus and their mutual friend Titus Pomponius Atticus . 

The dialogue begins with the trio taking a leisurely stroll through Cicero 's familial estate at Arpinum and they begin to discuss how the laws should be . 

Cicero uses this as a platform for expounding on his theories of natural law of harmony among the classes . 

The three remaining books ( out of an indeterminate number , although Jonathan Powell and Niall Rudd in their translation for Oxford seem to argue that it may have been six , to bring it in line with the number in de re publica ) , in order , expound on Cicero 's beliefs in Natural Law , recasts the religious laws of Rome ( in reality a rollback to the religious laws under the king Numa Pompilius ) and finally talk of his proposed reforms to the Roman Constitution . 

Whether or not the work was meant as an earnest plan of action is unknown . 

Cicero 's basic conservative and traditionalist beliefs led him to imagine an idealized Rome before the Gracchi , with the classes still in harmony . 

From there , he reformed the worst points of the Roman constitution , while keeping the majority of it . 

Cicero 's proposed constitution in Book Three must be seen as a renovation of the existing order , not a call to shatter the order and build anew . 

However , less than a decade after the accepted date for his beginning the manuscript , Julius Caesar crossed the Rubicon , launching the civil war that would end the Republic .
