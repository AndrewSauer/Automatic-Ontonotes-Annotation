Louis Pierre Althusser ( , ; ; 16 October 1918 – 22 October 1990 ) was a French Marxist philosopher . 

He was born in Algeria and studied at the École Normale Supérieure in Paris , where he eventually became Professor of Philosophy . 

Althusser was a longtime member — although sometimes a strong critic — of the French Communist Party . 

His arguments and theses were set against the threats that he saw attacking the theoretical foundations of Marxism . 

These included both the influence of empiricism on Marxist theory , and humanist and reformist socialist orientations which manifested as divisions in the European communist parties , as well as the problem of the " cult of personality " and of ideology . 

Althusser is commonly referred to as a Structural Marxist , although his relationship to other schools of French structuralism is not a simple affiliation and he was critical of many aspects of structuralism . 

Althusser 's life was marked by periods of intense mental illness . 

In 1980 , he killed his wife , the sociologist Hélène Rytmann , by strangling her . 

He was declared unfit to stand trial due to insanity and was committed to a psychiatric hospital for three years . 

He did little further academic work , dying in 1990 .
