The statue of George III , Somerset House , formally titled George III and the River Thames , is a Grade I listed outdoor bronze sculptural group depicting King George III and Neptune or Father Thames , located in the quadrangle of Somerset House , London , England . 

The sculptor was John Bacon , and the statue was erected between 1778 and 1789 . 

George III is dressed in Roman apparel , leaning on a rudder , flanked by the prow of a Roman boat and a lion . 

Father Thames is reclining on a lower , semi - circular plinth , one hand on an urn with a cornucopia behind him . 

When Queen Charlotte first saw the statue of her husband she asked the sculptor ' Why did you make so frightful a figure ? ' . 

Bacon bowed and replied ' Art can not always effect what is ever within the reach of Nature â€“ the union of beauty and majesty . '
