Huracán Ramírez ( Spanish for " Hurricane Ramirez " ) was the ring name of Mexican luchador enmascarado , or masked professional wrestler Daniel García Arteaga ( April 9 , 1926 – October 31 , 2006 ) . 

García was neither the first , nor the last , wrestler to work under the name " Huracán Ramírez " . 

He was given the name in the mid-1950s , when the wrestler Eduardo Bonada who originally played Huracan in the 1952 film Huracán Ramírez decided to give up the role in the ring because he no longer wanted to obscure his face with the mask . 

Thus Garcia became the 2nd wrestler to wrestle in the ring under the Huracan identity . 

During his career , his true identity was a closely guarded secret except to the closest family and friends , more closely guarded that any other luchador of that period . 

Following his retirement the " Huracán Ramírez " name and mask has been used by others , primarily because García did not own the rights to the name and the mask . 

García , as Huracán Ramírez , was considered one of the most talented luchadors of his time and one of the most iconic luchadors of all time alongside wrestlers such as Santo , Blue Demon and Mil Mascaras . 

He invented and popularized a move called the / la Huracánrana , a move that is now commonly used by smaller , high flying professional wrestlers all over the world . 

During his career he worked as Huracán Ramírez in at least five of the eight movies in the Huracán Ramírez movie series , starting with the second one in 1962 . 

He also played the part of Santo in a biographical movie produced by Santo 's son El Hijo del Santo .
