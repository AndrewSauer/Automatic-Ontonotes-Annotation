Papat Limpad ( English : Four Champions ) is a seven - month writing competition in the Javanese - language Wikipedia . 

The purpose of this competition is to revitalize the " barely alive " Javanese - language Wikipedia . 

Javanese Wikipedia started in January 2003 , began to have a larger number of regular contributors in mid-2006 , and began to see its golden era for seven years in 2008 . 

However , the activity decreased and returned to 2006 status , with only 2 to 1 regular contributors for the last two years . 

The Javanese language Wikipedia ranked 71 in the number of pages being viewed by 1.2 million viewers a month ( before intervention ) . 

Wikimedia Indonesia believes that Javanese Wikipedia has an untapped potential growth and an untapped potential editor base that needs to be reached .
