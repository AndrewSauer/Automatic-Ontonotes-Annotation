Vithura is a small village situated 36 Â  km from Thiruvananthapuram , capital of the Kerala state in India . 

Vithura is the crossroads to various tourist , cultural , and religious centres . 

Surrounded by the Western Ghats ( Sahyadri ) , Vithura is a prime tourist spot . 

The Village is rich with scenic beauty and good climate . 

The campus for the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research , Thiruvananthapuram is being constructed here . 

There are several rubber plantations . 

Prominent tourist spots include Ponmudi , Peppara Dam , Meenmutty Falls , Bonacaud and Agastyakoodam . 

The 2001 census reports a population of 26,927 . 

A stones throw away from Vithura lies Iruthalamoola Junction in the Tholicode Panchayath . 

Iru in Malayalam means two and Thala means head and moola means corner . 

Perhaps the place got its name because the Trivandrum to Ponmudi and Vithura to Aryanad roads meet at Eruthalamoola Junction . 

Perched on a hill very close to Iruthalamoola stands a massive magnificent rock called Chittiparra . 

Chittiparra is frequented by adventure type tourists keen on the challenges of rock climbing . 

Lush green paddy fields , rubber plantations , coconut gardens abound in scenic Vithura which is a hot spot for the thousands of tea plantation workers who work in the hills . 

A visit to the rubber plantations , including the local kalaris ( Traditional Martial Arts Schools ) is a must to every visitor .
