Moshe Hirsch ( ) ( born 1923 or 1924â€”May 2 , 2010 ) was the leader of the anti - Zionist Neturei Karta group in Jerusalem . 

He advised Yasser Arafat on Jewish affairs and visited him in Ramallah . 

Following Hirsch 's death , shiva visitors included senior Fatah members , including Adnan al - Husayni ( who brought a personal letter of consolation from Mahmoud Abbas ) , Hatem Abdel Kader and Bilial A - Natsha . 

Hirsch was the son - in - law of the now deceased Neturei Karta founder Rabbi Aharon Katzenelbogen and his first wife , and was the leader of one of the movement 's factions . 

He was originally from New York City , and later moved to Jerusalem . 

Hirsch had one glass eye due to an injury sustained when someone threw acid in his face . 

According to his cousin , journalist Abraham Rabinovich , the incident had no link with Hirsch 's political activities but was connected to a real estate dispute .
