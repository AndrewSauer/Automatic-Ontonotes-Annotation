Zhang Zuo (; died 355 ) , courtesy name Taibo ( 太伯 ) , formally Prince Wei of ( Former ) Liang ( ( 前)涼威王 ) was a ruler of the Chinese state Former Liang . 

He was the only ruler of Former Liang to formally declare a break from Jin Dynasty ( 265 - 420 ) , and historical sources variously report him as having declared himself an emperor ( per Jin Shu ) or a prince ( per Zizhi Tongjian ) . 

He was commonly viewed as a usurper ( having seized the throne from his nephew Zhang Yaoling after his brother Zhang Chonghua 's death ) and initially not acknowledged as a Former Liang ruler , but his brother Zhang Tianxi later nevertheless gave him the posthumous name of Wei .
