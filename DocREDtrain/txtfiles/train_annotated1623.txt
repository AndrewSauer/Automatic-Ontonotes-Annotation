Of the twenty - five people who signed PNAC 's founding statement of principles , ten went on to serve in the administration of U.S. President George W. Bush , including Dick Cheney , Donald Rumsfeld , and Paul Wolfowitz . 

Observers such as Irwin Stelzer and Dave Grondin have suggested that the PNAC played a key role in shaping the foreign policy of the Bush Administration , particularly in building support for the Iraq War . 

Academics such as Inderjeet Parmar , Phillip Hammond , and Donald E. Abelson have said PNAC 's influence on the George W. Bush administration has been exaggerated . 

The Project for the New American Century ceased to function in 2006 ; it was replaced by a new think - tank named the Foreign Policy Initiative , co - founded by Kristol and Kagan in 2009 . 

The Foreign Policy Initiative was dissolved in 2017 .
