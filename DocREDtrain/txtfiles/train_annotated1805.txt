Blessed Elisabetta Sanna ( full name Elisabetta Sanna Porcu ) ( 23 April 1788 – 17 February 1857 ) was an Italian Roman Catholic from Codrongianos Province of Sassari who was an active member of both the Secular Franciscan Order and the Union of the Catholic Apostolate . 

In the latter she was a friend and compatriot of Saint Vincenzo Pallotti . 

As a result of smallpox , Sanna was for the most part disabled and further ailments prevented her from returning to her hometown after departing on a pilgrimage ; this forced her to take up residence in Rome where she later died . 

Sanna married and bore seven children but was widowed after almost two decades of marriage . 

Pope Francis proclaimed her to be Venerable in 2014 after determining that she lived a model Christian life of heroic virtue . 

The pope approved the miracle attributed to her in 2016 which allowed for her beatification to occur . 

Cardinal Angelo Amato – on the behalf of the pope – presided over the beatification on 17 September 2016 .
