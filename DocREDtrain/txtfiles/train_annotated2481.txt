The Aronson Prize ( ) is a prize awarded for achievements in microbiology and immunology . 

It was established by the will of the pediatrician and bacteriologist Hans Aronson and has been awarded since 1921 . 

Aronson bequeathed a large part of his estate to the establishment of the prize . 

The prize is awarded biannually on 8 March , the date of Aronson 's death . 

In 1969 , the foundation that awarded the prize was dissolved on the initiative of its last chairman Georg Henneberg , and the responsibility for the prize and the remaining capital was transferred to the ( West ) Berlin government , in order to safeguard the existence of the prize . 

Since 1970 , the prize has been awarded by the Senate of Berlin . 

The first laureate was August von Wassermann . 

Among the Aronson laureates are several scientists who later were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine , such as Karl Landsteiner and Gerhard Domagk .
