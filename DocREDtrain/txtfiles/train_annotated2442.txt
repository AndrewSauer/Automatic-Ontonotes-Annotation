Lisberg raised the flag for the first time on Faroese soil on 22 June 1919 on returning to his home town of Fámjin . 

It would not however receive official status until 25 April 1940 when the British occupation government approved its use as the civil ensign of the islands . 

Lisberg died of pneumonia on 31 August 1920 . 

He is buried in Fámjin , where the church now holds the original copy of the Merkið .
