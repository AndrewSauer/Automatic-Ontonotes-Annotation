Harold John Pye ( 27 November 1901 - 20 January 1986 ) was the son of William George Pye who , in 1896 , started a company called W G Pye which manufactured scientific and optical equipment . 

The firm prospered during the Second World War by manufacturing specialist equipment such as gun sights . 

After the war , new products needed to be found and the company started to manufacture radio parts and eventually a radio . 

Harold joined the firm and helped to develop a new radio which proved so successful that the radio manufacturing side of W G Pye and the rights to the name Pye Radio were bought . 

William and Harold continued to operate W G Pye making optical equipment . 

In 1949 , Pye Radio approached Harold with a substantial offer that would reunite the radio and optical divisions . 

The offer was accepted and Harold retired to become a farmer at Burnham on Crouch in Essex . 

He died at Ipswich , Suffolk , on 20 January 1986 .
