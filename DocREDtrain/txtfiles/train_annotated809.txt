François Caron ( 1600 – 1673 ) was a French Huguenot refugee to the Netherlands who served the Dutch East India Company ( Vereenigde Oost - Indische Compagnie or VOC ) for 30 years , rising from cabin boy to Director - General at Batavia ( Jakarta ) , only one grade below Governor - General . 

He was later to become Director - General of the French East Indies Company ( Compagnie française pour le commerce des Indes orientales ) ( 1667 – 1673 ) . 

He is sometimes considered the first Frenchman to set foot in Japan : he was actually born in Brussels to a family of French Huguenot refugees ; but he only became a naturalized citizen of France when he was persuaded by Colbert to become head of the French East Indies Company , which was intended to compete with the Dutch and the English in Asia . 

He disputes that honour with the French Dominican missionary Guillaume Courtet .
