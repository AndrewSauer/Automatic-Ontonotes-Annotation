Eat Your Face is the eighth album by the Huntington Beach , California punk rock band Guttermouth , released in 2004 by Epitaph Records and Volcom Entertainment . 

It was hailed as a " return to form " after the stylistic experimentations of 2002 's Gusto , going back to the band 's tried - and - true style of fast , abrasive punk rock with tongue - in - cheek humor and sarcastic lyrics . 

The album marked a period of transition for the band , whose founding guitarist Eric Davis had left the group early in 2004 and been replaced by Donald Horne . 

It was also their only album with bassist Kevin Clark , and their last with longtime drummer Ty Smith . 

Lyrically it retained the band â€™s sense of biting sarcasm and expressed dissatisfaction with the U.S. electoral system and the current state of punk rock in the mainstream , amongst other topics . 

In the summer of 2004 Guttermouth embarked on the Vans Warped Tour in support of Eat Your Face . 

However , the band 's outrageous behavior and propensity for stirring up controversy soon led to problems on the tour . 

Singer Mark Adkins would often openly insult other acts from onstage , and the band members mocked the anti - Republican agenda of many of the tour 's performers by selling T - shirts and displaying banners that proclaimed support for President George W. Bush . 

After several weeks the band abruptly left the tour , causing many rumors to circulate online and in the music press as to the reasons behind their departure , some claiming that they had been ejected and others that they had been asked to leave . 

Eventually Adkins issued a statement admitting that the band had left the tour voluntarily , due in part to his distate for the political atmosphere surrounding it . 

Eat Your Face was released jointly by Epitaph Records and Volcom Entertainment . 

It would be the band 's final recording for Epitaph , as they would move fully to Volcom for their next album , 2006 's Shave the Planet .
