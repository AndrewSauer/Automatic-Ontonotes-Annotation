The history of the Jews in Argentina goes back to the early sixteenth centuries , following the Jewish expulsion from Spain . 

Sephardi Jews fleeing persecution immigrated with explorers and colonists to settle in what is now Argentina . 

In addition , many of the Portuguese traders in the Viceroyalty of the RÃ­o de la Plata were Jewish . 

An organized Jewish community , however , did not develop until after Argentina gained independence from Spain in 1816 . 

By mid - century , Jews from France and other parts of Western Europe , fleeing the social and economic disruptions of revolutions , began to settle in Argentina . 

Reflecting the composition of the later immigration waves , the current Jewish population is 80 % Ashkenazi ; while Sephardic and Mizrahi are a minority . 

Argentina has the largest Jewish population of any country in Latin America , although numerous Jews left during the 1970s and 1980s to escape the repression of the military junta , emigrating to Israel , West Europe ( especially Spain ) , and North America . 

The Jewish population in Argentina is the largest in Latin America , the third largest in the Americas , and the world 's seventh largest outside Israel . 

During a major emigration wave in the 2000s , more than 10,000 Argentine Jews settled in Israel .
