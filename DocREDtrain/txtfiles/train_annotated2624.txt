Ghostwritten is the first novel published by English author David Mitchell . 

Published in 1999 , it won the John Llewellyn Rhys Prize and was widely acclaimed . 

The story takes place mainly around East Asia , but also moves through Russia , Britain , the USA and Ireland . 

It is written episodically ; each chapter details a different story and central character , although they are all interlinked through seemingly coincidental events . 

Many of the themes from Ghostwritten continue in Mitchell â€™s subsequent novels , number9dream and Cloud Atlas , and a character later appears in The Bone Clocks . 

Ghostwritten is the product of a number of influences , particularly from East Asian culture and superstition , as well as real events remodelled for plot purposes ( e.g. 

the sarin gas attack on the Tokyo subway ) . 

There are also hints and references to other works , most prominently from Isaac Asimov and the Three Laws of Robotics towards the end of the book , as well as Wild Swans by Jung Chang and The Music of Chance by Paul Auster .
