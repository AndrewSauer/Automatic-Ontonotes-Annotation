The Holy Spirit has been represented in Christian art both in the Eastern and Western Churches using a variety of depictions . 

The depictions have ranged from nearly identical figures that represent the three persons of the Holy Trinity from a dove to a flame . 

The Holy Spirit is often depicted as a dove , based on the account of the Holy Spirit descending like a dove on Jesus at his baptism . 

In many paintings of the Annunciation , the Holy Spirit is shown in the form of a dove , coming down towards Mary on beams of light , as the Archangel Gabriel announces Christ 's coming to Mary . 

A dove may also be seen at the ear of Saint Gregory the Great â”€ as recorded by his secretary or other church father authors , dictating their works to them . 

The dove also parallels the one that brought the olive branch to Noah after the deluge , as a symbol of peace . 

The book of Acts describes the Holy Spirit descending on the apostles at Pentecost in the form of a wind and tongues of fire resting over the apostles ' heads . 

Based on the imagery in that account , the Holy Spirit is sometimes symbolized by a flame . 

There are also depictions of the Holy Spirit in the book of Genesis . 

In The Vatican Museum in Rome is a carved stone sarcophagus depicting the Holy Trinity as three bearded men during the creation of Eve . 

The majority of early Christian art depicts The Holy Spirit in an anthropomorphic form as a human with two other Identical human figures representing God the Father and Jesus Christ . 

They either sit or they stand grouped closely together . 

This is used to portray the unity of The Godhead . 

The Holy Spirit is represented in various artistic mediums such as stained glass windows and calligraphy .
