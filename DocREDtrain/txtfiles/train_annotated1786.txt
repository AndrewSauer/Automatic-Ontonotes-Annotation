The history of jazz in Belgium starts with the Dinant instrument maker Adolphe Sax , whose saxophone became part of military bands in New Orleans around 1900 and would develop into the jazz instrument par excellence . 

From then on the early history of jazz in Belgium virtually runs parallel to developments in the country of the birth of jazz , from the minstrel shows in the late 19th century until the first Belgian jazz album in 1927 and beyond . 

Two important people in Belgium largely influenced the development of jazz in those early years : FÃ©lix - Robert Faecq and Robert Goffin . 

The Belgian jazz history yielded many internationally known jazz musicians and composers such as the harmonica player and guitarist Toots Thielemans , guitarist Philip Catherine and the gypsy jazz guitarist Django Reinhardt .
