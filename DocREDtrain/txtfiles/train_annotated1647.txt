The Cascadia official soccer team is the official soccer team representing the Cascadia region of the United States and Canada and is controlled by the Cascadia Association Football Federation ( CAFF ) . 

The team will be composed of players from the U.S states of Oregon , Washington and the Canadian province of British Columbia . 

The stated mission of the team is " ... to allow Cascadia as a distinct cultural entity , isolated bioregion and growing society with common interests to be represented at the international level in the sport we are all passionate about . " 

CAFF is a member of ConIFA . 

Cascadia is not a member of FIFA or any confederation or subconfederation as the region is wholly a part of both the United States or Canada . 

However , CAFF is not opposed to those organizations and sees itself coexisting as a non - FIFA regional representative team . 

In this way and similar to Catalonia 's national team , Cascadia 's players can participate in both FIFA and non - FIFA tournaments as non - FIFA " caps " have no bearing on being FIFA cap tied . 

It is hoped that the team will help expose more players from the region to international competition as well as foster a connection between the culture of Cascadia with other regions and peoples around the world . 

Cascadia will participate in the 2018 ConIFA World Football Cup . 

The purpose of the team is cultural and sport focused , not political as there are many different ideas as to what Cascadia 's common and increasingly interconnected economic and political future may become . 

Neither CAFF nor the team have any official stance on the Cascadia independence movement .
