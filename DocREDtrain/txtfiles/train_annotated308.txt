The Bastille Day military parade , also known as the 14 July military parade , translation of the French name of Défilé militaire du 14 juillet , is a French military parade that has been held on the morning of 14 July each year in Paris since 1880 , almost without exception . 

The parade passes down the Champs - Élysées from l'Arc de Triomphe to Place de la Concorde where the President of the French Republic , his government and foreign ambassadors to France stand . 

This is a popular event in France , broadcast on French TV , and is one of the oldest regular military parades in the world . 

In some years , invited detachments of foreign troops take part in the parade and foreign statesmen attend as guests . 

Smaller military parades are held in French garrison towns ( such as Marseille , Toulon , Brest , or Belfort ) .
