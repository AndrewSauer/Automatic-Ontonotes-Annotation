" Mighty Wings " is a song by American rock band Cheap Trick , released in 1986 as the third single from the soundtrack of the film Top Gun . 

It was written by Harold Faltermeyer and Mark Spiro , and produced by Faltermeyer . 

Despite the commercial success of the Top Gun soundtrack , and unlike the four other singles culled from the album , " Mighty Wings " failed to make an appearance in the Billboard chart . 

It was the third of five singles to be released from the soundtrack , following " Danger Zone " by Kenny Loggins and " Take My Breath Away " by Berlin . 

In the film Top Gun , the music ( without vocals ) is played in the first training session at Miramar , while the full version with vocals is played during the ending credits .
