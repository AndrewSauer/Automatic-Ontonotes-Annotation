Post - Impressionism ( also spelled Postimpressionism ) is a predominantly French art movement that developed roughly between 1886 and 1905 , from the last Impressionist exhibition to the birth of Fauvism . 

Post - Impressionism emerged as a reaction against Impressionists ' concern for the naturalistic depiction of light and colour . 

Due to its broad emphasis on abstract qualities or symbolic content , Post - Impressionism encompasses Neo - Impressionism , Symbolism , Cloisonnism , Pont - Aven School , and Synthetism , along with some later Impressionists ' work . 

The movement was led by Paul CÃ©zanne ( known as father of Post - impressionism ) , Paul Gauguin , Vincent van Gogh , and Georges Seurat . 

The term Post - Impressionism was first used by art critic Roger Fry in 1906 . 

Critic Frank Rutter in a review of the Salon d'Automne published in Art News , 15 October 1910 , described Othon Friesz as a " post - impressionist leader " ; there was also an advert for the show The Post - Impressionists of France . 

Three weeks later , Roger Fry used the term again when he organized the 1910 exhibition , Manet and the Post - Impressionists , defining it as the development of French art since Manet . 

Post - Impressionists extended Impressionism while rejecting its limitations : they continued using vivid colours , often thick application of paint , and real - life subject matter , but were more inclined to emphasize geometric forms , distort form for expressive effect , and use unnatural or arbitrary colour .
