Petre Otskheli ( ) ( November 25 , 1907 – December 2 , 1937 ) was a Georgian modernist set and costume designer who designed in theatre in Georgia and briefly in Moscow . 

He was put to death during Joseph Stalin ’s Great Purge at the age of 30 , but his scenographic constructivism has had a lasting influence on the Georgian scenic design . 

Born in Kutaisi , Otskheli studied at the Kutaisi realschule and the Tbilisi State Academy of Arts in the 1920s . 

Through most of his career Otskheli had a creative relationship with the director Kote Marjanishvili who invited the young artist to his theatre in Kutaisi in 1928 . 

Otskheli ’s visual experiments and skillful use of stage for massive designs with a series of subtle elements earned him recognition , but he soon came under pressure from Stalin ’s lieutenant in the Caucasus , Lavrentiy Beria . 

In 1936 , Otskheli fled Beria ’s persecution to Moscow where he was recruited by his fellow countryman Sergo Amaghlobeli , then the director of Moscow Maly Theatre . 

In 1937 , both Otskheli and Amaghlobeli were arrested and shot on trumped - up charges of treason .
