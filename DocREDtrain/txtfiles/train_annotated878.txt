It was released in August 2017 for PlayStation 4 , Xbox One , Microsoft Windows , OS X and Linux , with versions for Android , iOS , and Nintendo Switch in 2018 . 

In the game , players must survive being stranded on an island filled with roaming dinosaurs and other prehistoric animals , natural hazards , and potentially hostile human players . 

The game is played from either a third - person or first - person perspective and its open world is navigated on foot or by riding a prehistoric animal . 

Players can use firearms and improvised weapons to defend against hostile humans and creatures , with the ability to build bases as defense . 

The game has both single - player and multiplayer options . 

Multiplayer allows the option to form tribes of members in a server . 

The max number of tribe mates varies from each server . 

In this mode all tamed dinosaurs and building are shared between the members . 

Development began in October 2014 , where it was first released as an early access title in mid-2015 . 

The development team conducted research into the physical appearance of the animals , but took creative license for gameplay purposes . 

A companion app , titled Dododex , was released for mobile devices in August 2017 . 

One of the game modes , Survival of the Fittest , was also released as a standalone game the same month . 

Egypt - based developer Instinct Games was hired to facilitate the game 's development .
