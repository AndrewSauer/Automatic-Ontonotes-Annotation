Australia ( Whore of the world ) is a climate change protest song written by singer - songwriter John Gordon and released in late 2010 . 

The song laments Australia 's mining culture - especially coal mining in Australia and coal exports - likening the country to a ' mining whore ' . 

It has featured in a wide variety of Australian press and online media , including mining forums , and continues to garner attention due to its controversial and provocative message . 

Music press have hailed the song as one of the great contemporary Australian protest songs . 

The Melbourne Age went as far as to say that Midnight Oil 's ' Blue Sky Mine ' has nothing on ' Australia ( Whore of the World ) ' . 

The Song has been banned by ABC Local Radio Southern Queensland ( Australian Broadcasting Corporation ) as being too provocative for a conservative audience . 

ABC Southern Queensland encompasses the Toowoomba and Darling Downs region which is the region where Gordon hails from originally and where he has performed the song at a number of anti - mining rallies . 

The song has however received airplay in other parts of Australia from the ABC , and has been showcased on the national flagship ABC Environment website . 

As of May 2011 , Gordon is contesting the Toowoomba ruling with the case currently before the independent ABC Consumer and Audience review board . 

Australia ( Whore of the world ) was recorded using only pump organ ( harmonium ) and guitar as vocal accompaniment . 

The song was written in the Ngaanyatjarra lands of Western Australia where Gordon works in music production and development .
