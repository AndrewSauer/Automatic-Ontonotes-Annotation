Balhannah is a town in the Adelaide Hills about 30 Â  km southeast of Adelaide , the capital of South Australia . 

It was established in 1839 as a farming community by James Turnbull Thomson , who built the first hotel . 

The town soon grew to incorporate two once adjoining towns : Gilleston ( named for Osmond Gilles ) and Blythetown , named for James Blythe , another Scottish settler . 

It is on the main interstate railway between Adelaide and Melbourne . 

In the past it was the junction for a branch line that ran up the Onkaparinga Valley and beyond to Birdwood and Mount Pleasant . 

Much of Balhannah is along Onkaparinga Valley Road , although there are some other residential streets , and Greenhill Road terminates near the town centre . 

One of the larger businesses in the town is a long - established hardware store , now part of the Mitre 10 chain . 

The fruit cold store built in 1914 was one of the first in Australia and is still in use .
