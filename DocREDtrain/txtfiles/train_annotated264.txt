" Make Me Bad " is a song written and recorded by the American nu metal band Korn for their fourth studio album , Issues . 

Many Korn fans interpret the lyrics to be about frontman Jonathan Davis ' getting tired of drinking or drug abuse and his decision to get sober a year prior to Issues coming out . 

It was released as the album 's second single in February 2000 , enjoying major success on US rock radio stations and in the United Kingdom . 

The Alien - inspired music video is one of the most expensive videos Korn have ever filmed featuring actors Brigitte Nielsen , Udo Kier , Tatjana Patitz , and Shannyn Sossamon . 

An acoustic medley of " Make Me Bad " and The Cure 's " In Between Days " was performed with The Cure for the series in December 2006 .
