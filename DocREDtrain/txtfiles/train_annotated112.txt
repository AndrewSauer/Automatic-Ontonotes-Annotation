José María Mijares ( born 1921 in Havana , Cuba ) is a Cuban contemporary visual artist . 

He began drawing in his adolescent years and entered the San Alejandro Academy of Fine Arts on a scholarship at the age of 16 . 

His greatest influences were the artists of the " Havana School " : Carlos Enríquez , René Portocarrero , Cundo Bermúdez , as well as his professors , most notable being modernist painter Fidelio Ponce . 

He was also a part of the influential group , Los Diez Pintores Concretos ( the 10 Concrete Painters ) , or as they are usually referred to , Los Diez ( the 10 ) . 

Although the group had a relatively short life , 1959 - 1961 , and exhibited together only a few times , they remain an important part of Cuba 's art history especially in the pre - Castro years and leading up to the revolution . 

He left Cuba in 1968 , resigning his teaching position at the academy when Fidel Castro came into power . 

Based in Miami , he continued to be a prolific painter and until his death in 2004 , at the age of 82 .
