The Emperor 's Bridge Campaign is a San Francisco - based nonprofit whose mission is to honor the life and advance the legacy of Joshua Abraham Norton ( c.1818 – 1880 ) , better known as the 19th - century San Francisco eccentric , Emperor Norton . 

The Campaign was launched on 28 September 2013 as a project to carry forward the call of a 1 August 2013 Change.org petition to name the San Francisco - Oakland Bay Bridge — long known locally simply as " the Bay Bridge "— for Emperor Norton , who set out the original vision for the bridge with three newspaper proclamations published in 1872 . 

Subsequently , the organization has positioned this bridge - naming project within a larger public mission that includes research and documentation ; education ; and advocacy concerning the full life and legacy of Emperor Norton . 

The Campaign incorporated as a nonprofit in October 2014 .
