Vudu , Inc. is an American content delivery and media technology company responsible for Vudu - branded interactive media services and devices . 

Vudu distributes full - length movies over the Internet to televisions in the United States of America and Canada . 

It does this with a content delivery network that uses a hybrid peer - to - peer TV technology . 

Vudu was acquired by Walmart in March 2010 . 

Vudu began by only making its own set - top boxes ( the Vudu Box and the Vudu XL ) , but Vudu now primarily markets its software as a smart TV / connected TV platform and video on demand ( VoD ) distribution service to third - party consumer electronics devices . 

Vudu is also available via PlayStation 3 , PlayStation 4 , Xbox 360 , Xbox One , iPad , Android TV , Apple TV ( 4th gen and 4 K ) , TiVo Roamio , and Roku devices ( such as Roku 2 , Roku 3 , Roku 4 and Roku Stick ) , as well as most smartphones via the Vudu app ( Android and iOS ) which also supports Chromecast use . 

As of December 2011 , the Vudu app within the downloadable version of the Boxee media player is no longer supported , due to DRM and certification requirements .
