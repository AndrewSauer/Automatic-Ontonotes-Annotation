The Istro - Romanian language ( Istro - Romanian : Rumârește ) is an Eastern Romance language , spoken in a few villages and hamlets in the peninsula of Istria in Croatia , as well as in diaspora , most notably in Italy , Sweden , Germany , Northern and Southern America , and Australia . 

While its speakers call themselves Rumeri , Rumeni , they are also known as Vlachs , Rumunski , Ćići and Ćiribiri . 

The last two , used by ethnic Croats , originated as a disparaging nickname for the language , rather than its speakers . 

Due to the fact that its speakers are estimated to be less than 500 ( the " smallest ethnic group in Europe " ) , it is listed among languages that are " seriously endangered " in the UNESCO Red Book of Endangered Languages . 

It is also considered by some Romanian scholars as a dialect of the Romanian language .
