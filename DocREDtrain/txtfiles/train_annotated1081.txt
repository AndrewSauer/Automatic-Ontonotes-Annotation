Fort San Miguel , or Yuquot , or Friendly Cove , is a small settlement of around six people - The Williams family of the Mowachaht band , plus two full - time lighthouse keepers , located on Nootka Island in Nootka Sound , just west of Vancouver Island , British Columbia , Canada . 

It was the summer home of Chief Maquinna and the Mowachaht / Muchalaht ( Nuu - chah - nulth ) people for generations , housing approximately 1,500 natives in 20 traditional wooden longhouses . 

The name means " Wind comes from all directions " in Nuu - chah - nulth . 

The community is located within the Strathcona Regional District but like all Indian Reserve communities is not governed by nor represented in the regional district . 

The Mowchaht / Muchalaht First Nations are rather part of the Nuu - chah - nulth Tribal Council , which unites the governments of the indigenous communities of the Island 's West Coast . 

The Canadian government declared Friendly Cove a National Historic Site in 1923 , with recognition of the significance of the Spanish colonial settlement that was once there and First Nations history following in 1997 .
