While a graduate student at the University of California , Berkeley from 1976 to 1979 , under the direction of Donald Sarason , he obtained a new proof of the corona theorem , a famously difficult theorem in complex analysis . 

He was made Professor of Mathematics at Caltech in 1986 , and was there from 1988 – 1992 and from 1995 to his death in a car accident in 2000 . 

He also held positions at the University of Washington , University of Chicago , New York University , and University of California , Berkeley .
