The Battle of Ager Falernus ( or the Battle of the Falernian Territory ) was a skirmish during the Second Punic War between the armies of Rome and Carthage . 

After winning the Battle of Lake Trasimene in Italy in 217 BC , the army commanded by Hannibal marched south and reached Campania . 

The Carthaginians ultimately moved into the district of Falernum , a fertile river valley surrounded by mountains . 

Quintus Fabius Maximus Verrucosus , who had been elected Roman dictator and commander of the Roman field forces after the disastrous defeat at Trasimene , had dogged Hannibal and stuck to a strategy to fight only under favourable conditions ( Fabian Strategy ) . 

He now occupied all the river crossings and mountain passes leading out of the valley , thus blocking the Carthaginians inside . 

After stripping the area of grain , cattle and other supplies , Hannibal displayed brilliant tactics to provoke the Roman guard to leave one of the passes . 

Despite the protests of his staff officers Fabius , who was camped near the pass with his main forces , refused to attack the Carthaginian army and it escaped the trap unscathed .
