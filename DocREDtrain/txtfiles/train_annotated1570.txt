Ernie Pike is a comics series written by Héctor Germán Oesterheld and originally drawn by Hugo Pratt , starring a World War II and Korean War reporter . 

It was first published in the magazine " Hora Cero " in Buenos Aires , Argentina , in 1957 . 

The reporter , loosely based on the real reporter Ernie Pyle , acts as a narrator of stories , without being directly involved in them . 

Such stories do not narrate real battles or exploits of noteworthy military people , being instead tragic stories of unknown soldiers , made up by the author . 

Oesterheld worked again with the character during the time of the Vietnam War , and Ricardo Barreiro used it for a brief story about the Falklands War .
