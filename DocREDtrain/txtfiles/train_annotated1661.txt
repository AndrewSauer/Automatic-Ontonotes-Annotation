First Tennessee Field was a proposed Minor League Baseball stadium in Nashville , Tennessee . 

The new ballpark was to be built on the banks of the Cumberland River in downtown Nashville on the former site of the Nashville Thermal Transfer Plant . 

It would have been home to the Nashville Sounds , a Triple - A baseball team of the Pacific Coast League , replacing Herschel Greer Stadium . 

The Memphis - based financial services company First Tennessee agreed to a $ 4.125   million deal for naming rights to the proposed stadium . 

The ballpark would have been the central part of a $ 200   million retail , entertainment , and residential complex , which was expected to continue the revitalization of Nashville 's " SoBro " ( South of Broadway ) district . 

In 2007 , the project and plans for the ballpark were canceled .
