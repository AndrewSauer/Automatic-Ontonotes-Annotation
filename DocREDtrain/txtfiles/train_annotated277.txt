Earth Spacedock is a fictional space station orbiting Earth in the Star Trek universe , designed originally by David Carson and Nilo Rodis of Industrial Light and Magic in the 1980s . 

It is large enough to contain several starships of that fictional universe , and in real life the Spacedock consisted of a series of sets , miniatures , and designs that were used for various films and television shows in the 1980s and 1990s . 

Written spacedock ( one word ) , it is first seen in the 1984 theater film , and subsequently in the , , and Star Trek movies . 

The spacedock also makes appearances in The Next Generation - era trilogy of seven season shows ( TNG , Deep Space Nine , and Voyager ) of the 1980s and 1990s . 

Space stations of this class in orbit around other places are shown many times in TNG , In this era before computer generated spacecraft , models were expensive so they were often re - used to increase efficiency of the budget . 

In 2015 a set of artwork printings and miniature model of the Spacedock design went to auction for over . 

One filming model for the interior ( for spacecraft shots inside the dock ) was across and was built by Industrial Light and Magic special effect makers for motion pictures and TV . 

This was an advanced model in an era before computer generated images became common , and it had various neon lights and doors which could open for the special effects shots . 

The design contained miles / kilometers of fiberoptics for lighting . 

Earth Spacedock has a cameo of sorts , shown being underconstruction in Earth orbit in the season one finale of , a show set a decade before the original Star Trek ( 1966 - 69 ) in its primary science fiction universe .
