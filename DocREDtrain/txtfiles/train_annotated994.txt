Police Review ( also known as Jane 's Police Review ) was a weekly magazine for police officers in the United Kingdom , latterly published by Jane 's Information Group . 

The magazine was founded in 1893 as The Police Review and Parade Gossip , aiming to ( in its own words ) ' cultivate the self - respect of the constabulary of this country , to raise them in the esteem and regard of all their fellow citizens ' . 

Since its foundation , the magazine was published every week without fail , celebrating the appearance of its 6000th issue on 10 October 2008 . 

On 18 November 2011 Police Review ceased publication in all forms . 

The magazine acted as an independent forum for the sharing of opinions and a supporter of various campaigns to improve standards in policing . 

Issues covered by the magazine have ranged from complaints about the discomfort of regulation footwear to disputes about pay reform .
