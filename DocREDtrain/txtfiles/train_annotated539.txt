Germinie Lacerteux ( 1865 ) is a grim , anti - Romantic novel by Edmond and Jules de Goncourt in which the authors aim to present , as they say , a " clinic of love . " 

It is the fourth of six novels they wrote . 

The story is that of a poor country girl who comes to Paris , where her temperament renders her peculiarly liable to temptation . 

She succumbs to nymphomania , which finally brings her to death on a hospital cot . 

The study is based on actual observation by the authors of their own maidservant , Rose Malingre , whose double life they had never suspected . 

It was dramatized by Edmond de Goncourt , and produced at the Od√©on in 1889 .
