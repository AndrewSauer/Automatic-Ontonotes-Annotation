The City of Thuringowa ( ) was a city and local government area in North Queensland , Australia covering the northern and western parts of what is now Townsville . 

The suburb of Thuringowa Central is the main business centre in this area . 

Thuringowa was named after the German state of Thuringia where the shire 's first chairman , John von Stieglitz originated . 

Prior to its proclamation as a city on 1 January 1986 , Thuringowa was a large rural shire , almost surrounding the City of Townsville . 

In 2007 the Queensland Government recommended that the Thuringowa City Council and the Townsville City Council be merged as part of the review of councils and boundaries , with the merged entity to be referred to as the Townsville City Council and the city being called the New Townsville City . 

The transition was completed with the election of a new combined Council on 15 March 2008 .
