A grid cell is a type of neuron in the brains of many species that allows them to understand their position in space . 

Grid cells were discovered in 2005 by Edvard Moser , May - Britt Moser and their students Torkel Hafting , Marianne Fyhn and Sturla Molden at the Centre for the Biology of Memory ( CBM ) in Norway . 

They were awarded the 2014 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine together with John O'Keefe for their discoveries of cells that constitute a positioning system in the brain . 

The arrangement of spatial firing fields all at equal distances from their neighbors led to a hypothesis that these cells encode a cognitive representation of Euclidean space . 

The discovery also suggested a mechanism for dynamic computation of self - position based on continuously updated information about position and direction . 

In a typical experimental study , an electrode capable of recording the activity of an individual neuron is implanted in the cerebral cortex of a rat , in a section called the dorsomedial entorhinal cortex , and recordings are made as the rat moves around freely in an open arena . 

For a grid cell , if a dot is placed at the location of the rat 's head every time the neuron emits an action potential , then as illustrated in the adjoining figure , these dots build up over time to form a set of small clusters , and the clusters form the vertices of a grid of equilateral triangles . 

This regular triangle - pattern is what distinguishes grid cells from other types of cells that show spatial firing . 

By contrast , if a place cell from the rat hippocampus is examined in the same way ( i.e. , by placing a dot at the location of the rat 's head whenever the cell emits an action potential ) , then the dots build up to form small clusters , but frequently there is only one cluster ( one " place field " ) in a given environment , and even when multiple clusters are seen , there is no perceptible regularity in their arrangement .
