Reisa National Park ( ) is a national park in Nordreisa Municipality in Troms county , Norway that was established by royal decree on 28 November 1986 . 

The park has much wildlife . 

The rough - legged buzzard is the most common bird of prey , but hikers may also spot golden eagle , kestrels , and gyrfalcon . 

Wolverines and lynx live in the park and surrounding mountains . 

The Sámi name for part of the gorge , Njállaávzi , means Arctic fox gorge , suggesting that the Arctic fox must have lived there a long time . 

The largest Norwegian predator , the brown bear , is occasionally seen in the park . 

The Reisa river has cut a valley and a canyon ( north of Imo ) in the mountain plateau , producing the long fertile valley called Reisadalen . 

Waterfalls cascade into the valleys and gorges . 

The waterfall Mollisfossen is one of the more spectacular falls at in height . 

The valley and adjacent mountains have been valuable for hunting , animal trapping , and fishing for centuries . 

Snares are sometimes still set to catch ptarmigan and willow grouse in the traditional manner . 

Scots pine were used for timber and to produce tar . 

Nearly every farm in the valley earned extra income making tar , and production continued far into the 20th century . 

The remains of many tar kilns can still be found . 

The park and surrounding areas provided spring , summer , and autumn grazing for semi - domesticated reindeer . 

In winter , the reindeer in this region graze in the Kautokeino district in nearby Finnmark county ; in summer , they are on the coast in the northwest . 

It is adjacent to Käsivarsi Wilderness Area in Finland .
