This article lists the Margraves and Electors of Brandenburg during the period of time that Brandenburg was a constituent state of the Holy Roman Empire . 

The Mark , or March , of Brandenburg was one of the primary constituent states of the Holy Roman Empire . 

It was created in 1157 as the Margraviate of Brandenburg by Albert the Bear , Margrave of the Northern March . 

In 1356 , by the terms of the Golden Bull of Charles IV , the Margrave of Brandenburg was given the permanent right to participate in the election of the Holy Roman Emperor with the title of Elector ( ) . 

The early rulers came from several different dynasties , but from 1415 Brandenburg and its successor states were ruled by the House of Hohenzollern for over 500 years . 

From 1618 onward , Brandenburg was ruled in personal union with the Duchy of Prussia . 

The Hohenzollerns raised Prussia to a kingdom as the Kingdom of Prussia in 1701 , and from then on Brandenburg was de facto treated as part of the kingdom even though it was legally still part of the Holy Roman Empire . 

The titles of Margrave of Brandenburg and Elector of Brandenburg were abolished along with the Holy Roman Empire in 1806 , and Brandenburg was formally integrated into Prussia . 

Despite this , the Prussian kings still included the title " Margrave of Brandenburg " in their royal style . 

From 1871 to 1918 the Hohenzollerns were also German Emperors .
