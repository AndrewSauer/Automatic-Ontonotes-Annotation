Land and Sea is a locally produced Canadian documentary television show broadcast in Newfoundland and Labrador on CBNT - DT in St. John 's , and on all CBC Television outlets throughout the province . 

It has been on the air since 1964 ( interrupted only by a short cancellation in the early 1990s , but revived after an outcry from fans ) , and is the longest running regional television program on CBC Television . 

Originally a black - and - white program , it began broadcasting in colour in the late 1960s / early 1970s . 

There is also a Maritime version of Land and Sea which is broadcast on the full CBC network on Sunday afternoons , and episodes from that version are often alternated with Newfoundland - based episodes .
