The Zanj Rebellion ( ) was a major uprising against the Abbasid Caliphate , which took place from 869 until 883 . 

Begun near the city of Basra in present - day southern Iraq and led by one ' Ali ibn Muhammad , the insurrection is traditionally believed to have involved some enslaved Bantu - speaking people ( Zanj ) who had originally been captured from the coast of East Africa and transported to the Middle East . 

It grew to involve many slaves and free men from several regions of the Caliphate , and claimed tens of thousands of lives before it was finally defeated . 

Several Muslim historians , such as al - Tabari and al - Mas'udi , consider the Zanj revolt to be one of the " most vicious and brutal uprisings " of the many disturbances that plagued the Abbasid central government . 

Modern scholars have characterized the conflict as being " one of the bloodiest and most destructive rebellions which the history of Western Asia records , " while at the same time praising its coverage as being among the " most fully and extensively described campaign[s ] in the whole of early Islamic historical writing . " 

The precise composition of the rebels remains a subject of debate , both as regards their identity and as to the proportion of slaves and free among them â€“ available historical sources being open to various interpretations .
