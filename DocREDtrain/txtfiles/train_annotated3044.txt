The National Socialist Movement of Norway ( , NNSB ) , formerly Zorn 88 , is a Norwegian neo - Nazi group with an estimated fifty members , led by Erik Rune Hansen . 

Founded in 1988 , it is a secretive group with tight membership regulation . 

The NNSB expresses admiration for Adolf Hitler and Vidkun Quisling , and is focused on historical revisionism and antisemitism , particularly Holocaust denial . 

It publishes the magazine Gjallarhorn , and in 1999 published The Protocols of the Elders of Zion . 

Other recurrent topics include racial hygiene and Norse religion . 

Several of its members were active Nazis and members of Nasjonal Samling during World War II . 

The group has had ties to Erik Bl√ºcher and the magazine Folk og Land , and to Varg Vikernes . 

It has been part of international networks along with the World Union of National Socialists , the National Socialist Movement of Denmark , the ( now - defunct ) Swedish National Socialist Front , and Blood & Honour . 

Along with Scandinavian groups it has taken part in celebrations and memorials to Adolf Hitler and Rudolf Hess . 

In November 2007 , a memorial ceremony at the German war cemetery in Oslo was attacked by anti - fascists , leaving five NNSB - members wounded , one severely . 

The NNSB pledged that it had no intentions of retaliating the attack .
