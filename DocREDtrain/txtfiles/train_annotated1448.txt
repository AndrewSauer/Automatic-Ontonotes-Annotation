Otto Friedrich Karl Deiters (; November 15 , 1834 â€“ December 5 , 1863 ) was a German neuroanatomist . 

He was born in Bonn , studied at the University of Bonn , and spent most of his professional career in Bonn . 

He is remembered for his microscopic research of the brain and spinal cord . 

Around 1860 , Deiters provided the most comprehensive description of a nerve cell that was known to exist at the time . 

He identified the cells ' axon , which he called an " axis cylinder " , and its dendrites , which he referred to as protoplasmic processes . 

He postulated that dendrites must fuse to form a continuous network . 

His name is lent to the " nucleus of Deiters " , also called the lateral vestibular nucleus , and to " Deiters ' cells " , structures that are associated with outer hair cells in the cochlea of the inner ear . 

Deiters died in 1863 from typhoid fever at the age of 29 . 

After his death , his work pertaining to nerve cells of the spinal cord was edited and published by anatomist Max Schultze ( 1825 - 1874 ) .
