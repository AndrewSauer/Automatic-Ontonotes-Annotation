Herman VI ( c. 1226 – 4 October 1250 ) was Margrave of Baden and titular margrave of Verona from 1243 until his death . 

A descendant of the Swabian House of Zähringen , he was the son of Margrave Herman V and Irmengard , daughter of Count Palatine Henry V of the Rhine . 

He succeeded his father in Baden on 16 January 1243 . 

In 1248 , he married Gertrude of Austria , the niece of the last male member of the Babenberg dynasty , Duke Frederick II of Austria ( 1230 – 1246 ) , and on the basis of that marriage claimed the duchies of Austria and Styria , leaving the rule over Baden to his younger brother Rudolf . 

However , he had a mighty rival in King Ottokar II of Bohemia , who in 1252 married Frederick 's sister Margaret to legitimize his claims . 

According to the Privilegium Minus issued by Emperor Frederick Barbarossa in 1156 , the Austrian lands could be bequeathed in the female line , and Herman even obtained the explicit consent by Pope Innocent IV . 

Nevertheless , the margrave and his son Frederick could not establish themselves in Austria and Styria against the resistance of the local nobility , who preferred Ottokar . 

Both rivals finally did not prevail , as the duchies were seized as reverted fiefs by the Habsburg king Rudolph I of Germany after Ottokar 's death at the Battle on the Marchfeld in 1278 .
