Wong Nai Siong was born in Fuzhou Ming Qing , where his father was a carpenter and his family was very poor . 

He had to work in the farm and study at the same time to provide for the family . 

In 1866 , missionaries from the Methodist Episcopal came ; Wong Nai Song was baptised and converted to Christianity in November that year . 

Although it was not to the liking of the villagers , he was not ostracised as they still regard him as from the same clan . 

As time went by , the villagers also converted to Christianity . 

In the winter of 1867 , priest Xu Yang Mei took Wong Nai Siong as an assistant and taught him the Bible . 

This led to Wong Nai Siong 's learning English and being exposed to Western culture and thinking . 

When asked his reason for converting to Christianity , he explained that he was appalled by the disparity between the teachings of Confucius and the actions of those who professed Confucianism .
