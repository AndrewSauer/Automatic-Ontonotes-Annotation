Florence Evelyn Nesbit ( December 25 , 1884   – January 17 , 1967 ) , known professionally as Evelyn Nesbit , was an American chorus girl , artists ' model , and actress . 

In the early part of the 20th century , Nesbit 's figure and face appeared frequently in mass circulation newspapers and magazine advertisements , on souvenir items , and calendars , making her a cultural celebrity . 

Her career began in her early teens in Philadelphia and continued in New York , where she posed for a cadre of respected artists of the era , including James Carroll Beckwith , Frederick S. Church , and notably Charles Dana Gibson , who idealized her as a " Gibson Girl " . 

She had the distinction of being an early fashion and artists ' model in an era when both fashion photography ( as an advertising medium ) and the pin - up ( as an art genre ) were just beginning their ascendancy . 

Nesbit achieved worldwide notoriety when her husband , the multimillionaire Harry Kendall Thaw , shot and killed Stanford White on the rooftop theatre of Madison Square Garden on the evening of June 25 , 1906 , leading to what the press would call the " Trial of the Century " . 

During the trial , Nesbit testified that as a stage performer , and while still a 14-year - old , she attracted the attention of the then 47-year - old architect and New York socialite Stanford White , who first gained her family 's trust then sexually assaulted her while she was unconscious .
