Joos van Cleve (; also Joos van der Beke ; c. 1485 â€“ 1540/1541 ) was a painter active in Antwerp around 1511 to 1540 . 

He is known for combining traditional Netherlandish painting techniques with influences of more contemporary Renaissance painting styles . 

An active member and co - deacon of the Guild of Saint Luke of Antwerp , he is known mostly for his religious works and portraits of royalty . 

As a skilled technician , his art shows sensitivity to color and a unique solidarity of figures . 

He was one of the first to introduce broad landscapes in the backgrounds of his paintings , which would become a popular technique of sixteenth century northern Renaissance paintings . 

He was the father of Cornelis van Cleve ( 1520 - 1567 ) who also became a painter . 

Cornelis became mentally ill during a residence in England and was therefore referred to as ' Sotte Cleef ' ( mad Cleef ) .
