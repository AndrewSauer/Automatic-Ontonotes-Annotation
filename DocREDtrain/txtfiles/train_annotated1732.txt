Bloeme Evers - Emden (; 26 July 1926 â€“ 18 July 2016 ) was a Dutch Jewish teacher and child psychologist who extensively researched the phenomenon of " hidden children " during World War II and wrote four books on the subject in the 1990s . 

Her interest in the topic grew out of her own experiences during World War II , when she was forced to go into hiding from the Nazis and was subsequently arrested and deported to Auschwitz on the last transport leaving the Westerbork transit camp on 3 September 1944 . 

Together with her on the train were Anne Frank and her family , whom she had known in Amsterdam . 

She was liberated on 8 May 1945 . 

In the 1980s , Evers - Emden earned a doctorate in developmental psychology and began interviewing and writing about the phenomenon of " hidden children " from the points of view of the children , their biological parents , their non - Jewish foster parents , and their non - Jewish foster siblings . 

She was also interviewed for several television documentaries on her remembrances of Anne Frank and her family before they went into hiding and after they were sent to Auschwitz .
