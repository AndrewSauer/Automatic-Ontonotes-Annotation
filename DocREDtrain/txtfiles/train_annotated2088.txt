The durian ( ) is the fruit of several tree species belonging to the genus Durio . 

There are 30 recognised Durio species , at least nine of which produce edible fruit , with over 100 named varieties in Indonesia , 300 in Thailand and 100 in Malaysia . 

Durio zibethinus is the only species available in the international market : other species are sold in their local regions . 

Regarded by many people in Southeast Asia as the " king of fruits " , the durian is distinctive for its large size , strong odour , and thorn - covered rind . 

The fruit can grow as large as long and in diameter , and it typically weighs one to three   kilograms ( 2 to 7   lb ) . 

Its shape ranges from oblong to round , the colour of its husk green to brown , and its flesh pale yellow to red , depending on the species . 

Some people regard the durian as having a pleasantly sweet fragrance , whereas others find the aroma overpowering with an unpleasant odour . 

The smell evokes reactions from deep appreciation to intense disgust , and has been described variously as rotten onions , turpentine , and raw sewage . 

The persistence of its odour , which may linger for several days , has led to the fruit 's banishment from certain hotels and public transportation in southeast Asia . 

By contrast , the nineteenth - century British naturalist Alfred Russel Wallace described its flesh as " a rich custard highly flavoured with almonds " . 

The flesh can be consumed at various stages of ripeness , and it is used to flavour a wide variety of savoury and sweet desserts in southeast Asian cuisines . 

The seeds can also be eaten when cooked .
