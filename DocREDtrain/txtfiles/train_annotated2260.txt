Theodor Hermann Meynert ( 15 June 1833 – 31 May 1892 ) was a German - Austrian psychiatrist , neuropathologist and anatomist born in Dresden . 

Meynert believed that disturbances in brain development could be a predisposition for psychiatric illness and that certain psychoses are reversible . 

In 1861 he earned his medical doctorate , and in 1875 became director of the psychiatric clinic associated with the University of Vienna . 

Some of his better known students in Vienna were Josef Breuer , Sigmund Freud , who in 1883 worked at Meynert 's psychiatric clinic , and Julius Wagner - Jauregg , who introduced fever treatment for syphilis . 

Meynert later distanced himself from Freud because of the latter 's involvement with practices such as hypnosis . 

Meynert also ridiculed Freud 's idea of male hysteria ; though some authors believe this to be due to his own hidden suffering of the illness , prompting a reconciliation with Freud near to his death . 

Other famous students of Meynert 's were Russian neuropsychiatrist Sergei Korsakoff ( 1854 – 1900 ) , German neuropathologist Carl Wernicke ( 1848–1905 ) and Swiss neuroanatomist Auguste - Henri Forel ( 1848 – 1931 ) . 

Meynert 's work was an important influence in the career of German neuropathologist Paul Flechsig ( 1847 – 1929 ) .
