Fatehpur Sikri ( ) is a town in the Agra District of Uttar Pradesh , India . 

The city itself was founded as the capital of Mughal Empire in 1571 by Emperor Akbar , serving this role from 1571 to 1585 , when Akbar abandoned it due to a campaign in Punjab and was later completely abandoned in 1610 . 

The name of the city derives from the village called Sikri which occupied the spot before . 

An Archaeological Survey of India ( ASI ) excavation from 1999 - 2000 indicated that there was a habitation , temples and commercial centres here before Akbar built his capital . 

It was also a much - loved place of Babur who called it Shukri for its lake of water needed for his armies . 

He used it for relaxation and also defeated Rana Sanga on its outskirts . 

The khanqah of Sheikh Salim existed earlier at this place . 

Akbar 's son Jahangir was born at the village of Sikri in 1569 and that year Akbar began construction of a religious compound to commemorate the Sheikh who had predicted the birth . 

After Jahangir 's second birthday , he began the construction of a walled city and imperial palace here . 

The city came to be known as Fatehpur Sikri , the " City of Victory " , after Akbar 's victorious Gujarat campaign in 1573 . 

After occupying Agra in 1803 , the English established an administrative center here and it remained so until 1850 . 

In 1815 , the Marquess of Hastings ordered repairment of monuments at Sikri .
