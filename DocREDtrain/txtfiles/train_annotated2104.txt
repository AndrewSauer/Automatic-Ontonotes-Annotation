Prince John of the United Kingdom ( John Charles Francis ; 12 July 1905 â€“ 18 January 1919 ) was the fifth son and youngest of the six children born to King George V and his wife , Queen Mary . 

At the time of John 's birth , his father was the Prince of Wales and heir apparent to the reigning monarch of the United Kingdom , King Edward VII . 

In 1910 , George succeeded to the throne upon Edward 's death and John became the fifth in line of succession . 

In 1909 , John was discovered to have epilepsy . 

As his condition deteriorated , he was sent to live at Sandringham House and was kept away from the public eye . 

There , he was cared for by his governess , " Lala " Bill , and befriended local children whom his mother had gathered to be his playmates . 

Prince John died at Sandringham in 1919 , following a severe seizure , and was buried at nearby St Mary Magdalene Church . 

His illness was disclosed to the wider public only after his death . 

Prince John 's alleged seclusion has subsequently been brought forward as evidence for the inhumanity of the royal family . 

However , records show that the Prince was in some ways given favourable treatment by his parents , in comparison with his siblings , and contrary to the belief that he was hidden from the public from an early age , John for most of his life was a " fully - fledged member of the family " , appearing frequently in public until after his eleventh birthday . 

His long acknowledged learning disability and a possible intellectual disability have both been linked to his severe epilepsy ; recent speculation finds some behaviours consistent with autism .
