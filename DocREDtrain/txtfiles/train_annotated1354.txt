is a work of detective fiction by Agatha Christie , first published in the United Kingdom by the Collins Crime Club in September 1934 and in the United States by Dodd , Mead and Company in 1935 under the title of The Boomerang Clue . 

The UK edition retailed at seven shillings and sixpence ( 7/6 ) and the US edition at $ 2.00 . 

Bobby Jones finds a man dying at his local golf course . 

A photo he saw in the man 's pocket is replaced , as police seek his identity . 

Bobby and his friend Lady Frances Derwent have adventures as they solve the mystery of the man 's last words , Why did n't they ask Evans ? 

The novel was praised at first publication as " a story that tickles and tantalises " , and that the reader is sure to like the amateur detectives and forgive the absence of Poirot . 

It had a lively narrative , full of action , with two amateur detectives who " blend charm and irresponsibility with shrewdness and good luck " . 

Robert Barnard , writing in 1990 , called it " Lively " but compared it to Evelyn Waugh 's Vile Bodies and felt that the detectives were too much the amateurs .
