For the DC Comics super - villain , see Kite Man . 

" The State " is a fictional totalitarian world government in a future history that forms the back - story of three of Larry Niven 's novels : A World Out of Time ( 1976 ) , The Integral Trees ( 1984 ) , and The Smoke Ring ( 1987 ) . 

It is also the setting of two short stories , " Rammer " ( which became the first chapter of A World Out of Time ) and " The Kiteman " ( printed in N - Space ) as well as a stalled fourth novel , The Ghost Ships . 

After several years in development , Niven announced that The Ghost Ships would never be made , and wrote The Ringworld Throne instead . 

The novel would have focused on a race of self - aware natural Bussard ramjets birthed in the supernova that created Levoy 's Star and were returning to their place of birth to mate . 

According to Playgrounds of the Mind , Kendy and the kite - fliers from " The Kiteman " would have returned also .
