Pope Fabian (; c. 200 â€“ 20 January 250 ) was the Bishop of Rome from 10 January 236 to his death in 250 , succeeding Anterus . 

He is famous for the miraculous nature of his election , in which a dove is said to have descended on his head to mark him as the Holy Spirit 's unexpected choice to become the next pope . 

He was succeeded by Cornelius . 

Most of his papacy was characterized by amicable relations with the imperial government , and Fabian could thus bring back to Rome the bodies of Pope Pontian and the antipope Hippolytus , both of whom had died in exile in the Sardinian mines , for Christian burial . 

It was also probably during his reign that the schism between the two corresponding Roman congregations of these leaders was ended . 

He was highly esteemed by Cyprian ; Novatian refers to his nobilissima memoriae , and he corresponded with Origen . 

One authority refers to him as Flavian . 

The Liber Pontificalis , a fourth - century document that survives in later copies , says that he divided Rome into diaconates and appointed secretaries to collect the records of the martyrs . 

He is also said , probably without basis , to have baptized the emperor Philip the Arab and his son . 

More plausible is the report in the Liberian Catalogue that he sent out seven " apostles to the Gauls " as missionaries . 

He died a martyr at the beginning of the Decian persecution and is venerated as a saint by the Catholic Church . 

Fabian 's feast day is commemorated on January 20 , the same as Saint Sebastian , in whose church his sepulcher lies in Rome .
