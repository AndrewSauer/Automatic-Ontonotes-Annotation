Public holidays in Canada , known as statutory holidays , stat holidays , or simply stats , consist of a variety of cultural , nationalistic , and religious holidays that are legislated in Canada at the federal or provincial and territorial levels . 

While many of these holidays are honoured and acknowledged nationwide , provincial and territorial legislation varies in regard to which are officially recognized . 

There are five nationwide statutory holidays , and six additional holidays for federal employees . 

Each of the 13 provinces and territories observes a number of holidays in addition to the nationwide days , but each varies in regard to which are legislated as either statutory , optional , or not at all . 

Currently , the provinces of Alberta and Prince Edward Island have the most legislated holidays in comparison to other provinces and territories , with 12 days off . 

Many public and private employers , as well as school systems , provide additional days off around the end of December , often including at least a full or half - day on December 24 ( Christmas Eve ) or December 31 ( New Year 's Eve ) , or in some cases the entire week between Christmas and New Year . 

While not officially legislated in any capacity , internationally notable cultural holidays such as Valentine 's Day , St. Patrick 's Day , Halloween , Mother 's Day , and Father 's Day are traditionally observed by Canadians as part of Canadian culture .
