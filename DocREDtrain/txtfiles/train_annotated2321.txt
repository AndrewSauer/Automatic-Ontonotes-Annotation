There are six monarchies in Oceania ; that is : self - governing sovereign states in Oceania where supreme power resides with an individual hereditary head , who is recognised as the head of state . 

Each is a constitutional monarchy , wherein the sovereign inherits his or her office , usually keeps it until death or abdication , and is bound by laws and customs in the exercise of their powers . 

Five of these independent states share Queen Elizabeth II as their respective head of state , making them part of a global grouping known as the Commonwealth realms ; in addition , all monarchies of Oceania are members of the Commonwealth of Nations . 

The only sovereign monarchy in Oceania that does not share a monarch with another state is Tonga . 

Australia and New Zealand have dependencies within the region and outside it , although five non - sovereign constituent monarchs are recognized by New Zealand , Papua New Guinea and France .
