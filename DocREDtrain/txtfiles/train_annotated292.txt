Bubble and squeak is a traditional British breakfast made from boiled potatoes and cabbage . 

In modern times it is a dish made with the shallow - fried leftover vegetables from a roast dinner . 

The main ingredients are potato and cabbage but carrots , peas , Brussels sprouts , or any other leftover vegetables may be added . 

The chopped vegetables ( and cold chopped meat if used ) are fried in a pan together with mashed potatoes or crushed roast potatoes until the mixture is well - cooked and brown on the sides . 

The dish is so named because the cabbage makes bubbling and squeaking sounds during the cooking process . 

It is often served with cold meat from the Sunday roast , and pickles or brown sauce , or as an accompaniment to a full English breakfast . 

The meat was traditionally added to the bubble and squeak itself , although nowadays it is more commonly made without meat . 

The earliest - known recipe was in Mrs Rundell 's A New System of Domestic Cookery in 1806 . 

The name bubble and squeak is used primarily in England ( for Scotland and Ireland see the section Similar dishes ) , and it may also be understood in parts of some other Commonwealth countries and the United States . 

Bubble and squeak has been a popular dish since the late 1800s , as it was an easy way of using leftovers . 

In more recent times , ready - made pre - prepared versions have become available on the market .
