The is a Tokyu skyscraper and retail complex completed in 2012 and located in the Shibuya shopping district of Tokyo , Japan . 

The Hikarie is 183 meters tall . 

As of November 2013 , it was tied for being the 52nd tallest skyscraper in Japan and 40th tallest building in Tokyo . 

The Hikarie features extensive use of LED lighting and displays and combines shopping / dining / entertainment in similar ways to the Roppongi Hills project . 

Its profile and significance are partially due to being immediately proximate to Shibuya Station , to which it is connected by both a 2nd - floor sky - walk and underground walkway . 

Although it does not yet have the same cultural significance as the 109 Building , it is a prime retail and office destination . 

The public access floors ( floors 1 - 11 ) are marked by glass - walling , allowing for views across Shibuya and Tokyo . 

Shibuya Hikarie features retail sales and event space up to floor 11 , at which point access is controlled to the theatre ( 11 - 16 ) and private office space ( 17 - 34 ) . 

Clients include KDDI and a number of headquarters for media companies .
