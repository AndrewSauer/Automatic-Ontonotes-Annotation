Panic Spring is a novel by Lawrence Durrell , published in 1937 by Faber and Faber in Britain and Covici - Friede in the United States under the pseudonym Charles Norden . 

It is set on a fictional Greek Island , Mavrodaphne , in the Ionian Sea somewhere between Patras , Kephalonia , and Ithaca . 

The island , however , resembles Corfu strongly , and in at least one inscribed copy of the novel , Durrell includes a map of Corfu identified as Mavrodaphne . 

The novel progresses through multiple perspectives in the successive chapters , each focusing on a different character . 

As a whole , the novel shows Durrell 's myriad influences of this period , ranging from Remy de Gourmont to Richard Aldington , D. H. Lawrence , and several Elizabethan writers .
