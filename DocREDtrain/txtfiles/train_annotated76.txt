The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development ( IBRD ) is an international financial institution that offers loans to middle - income developing countries . 

The IBRD is the first of five member institutions that compose the World Bank Group , and is headquartered in Washington , D.C. , United States . 

It was established in 1944 with the mission of financing the reconstruction of European nations devastated by World War II . 

The IBRD and its concessional lending arm , the International Development Association , are collectively known as the World Bank as they share the same leadership and staff . 

Following the reconstruction of Europe , the Bank 's mandate expanded to advancing worldwide economic development and eradicating poverty . 

The IBRD provides commercial - grade or concessional financing to sovereign states to fund projects that seek to improve transportation and infrastructure , education , domestic policy , environmental consciousness , energy investments , healthcare , access to food and potable water , and access to improved sanitation . 

The IBRD is owned and governed by its member states , but has its own executive leadership and staff which conduct its normal business operations . 

The Bank 's member governments are shareholders which contribute paid - in capital and have the right to vote on its matters . 

In addition to contributions from its member nations , the IBRD acquires most of its capital by borrowing on international capital markets through bond issues .

The Bank offers a number of financial services and products , including flexible loans , grants , risk guarantees , financial derivatives , and catastrophic risk financing .
