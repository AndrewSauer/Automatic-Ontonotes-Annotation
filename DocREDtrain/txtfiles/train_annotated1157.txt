Twisted City is a 2006 album by Dublin singer - songwriter Chris Singleton . 

A self - engineered and produced album , it took two and a half years to complete . 

The album was conceived as a tube journey through London ; every song was a ' stop on the line ' and dealt with Chris ' experiences of the city , both personal and professional . 

The album was mastered in May 2006 by well - known engineer Geoff Pesche ( Coldplay , Gorillaz , Kylie Minogue ) at Abbey Road Studios , London and was released in the UK and Ireland in September 2006 by Right Track / Universal Music Operations . 

Given the association between the album and the tube , the launch event for the album took place on the London Underground in August 2006 and attracted coverage from ITV News and BBC Radio . 

" Twisted City " received a warm welcome from rock critics , receiving positive reviews from The Irish Times , Hotpress , Clash Magazine and The Daily Express amongst others . 

Although Chris Singleton is an Irish artist , Twisted City takes as its main influences classic English rock . 

Particular influences include The Beatles ( see ' Pieces ' and ' Wherever ' ) , T.Rex ( in particular , ' Gimme Something ' ) , David Bowie ( ' Worry Number One ' ) and The Stone Roses ( ' The Only One ' ) . 

As a result of these influences , the album arguably has more of a ' rock band ' sound to it than those of other contemporary Irish singer - songwriters .
