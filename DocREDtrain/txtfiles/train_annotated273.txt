Gabber (; ) is a style of electronic music and a subgenre of hardcore techno . 

Although arguably a house variant from Detroit , techno music reached Amsterdam in the late 1980s , and it was the producers and DJs from Rotterdam in the early 1990s who evolved it , mixing it with industrial into a harder house variant which is today known as " gabber " . 

The specific sound of Rotterdam was also created as a reaction to the house scene of Amsterdam which was seen as " snobby and pretentious " . 

Though techno tracks from Frankfurt 's Marc Acardipane were quite similar to the Rotterdam style , it was the popularity of this music in the Netherlands which made Rotterdam the cradle of gabber . 

The essence of the gabber sound is a distorted bass drum sample , overdriven to the point where it becomes clipped into a distorted square wave and makes a recognizably melodic tone . 

Often the Roland Alpha Juno or the kick from a Roland TR-909 was used to create this sound . 

Gabber tracks typically include samples and synthesised melodies with the typical tempo ranging from 150 to 190 bpm . 

Violence , drugs and profanity are common themes in gabber , perceptible through its samples and lyrics , often screamed , pitch shifted or distorted . 

Gabber was popular in many countries , including the Netherlands , Belgium , Switzerland , Germany , Austria , and Italy . 

In the late 1990s , it became less popular than the emerging gabber - influenced hardstyle . 

After surviving underground for a number of years , in 2002 the style reappeared in the Netherlands in a new form , mainstream hardcore . 

The sound became more commercial , dark and industrial .
