The Glasscock County Courthouse is an historic courthouse building located in Garden City , Glasscock County , Texas . 

Built in 1909 to 1910 at a cost of $ 28,000 , it was designed by Georgia - born American architect Edward Columbus Hosford , who is noted for the courthouses and other buildings that he designed in Florida , Georgia and Texas . 

It was built of granite and rusticated stone with gable front porticoes on all sides , each of which is supported by four 2-story Doric columns . 

Unlike the Mason County Courthouse also designed by Hosford and built at the same time for $ 39,786 , the Glasscock County Courthouse has no clock tower cupola in the center of its roof and its side porticoes are smaller than the other two . 

The prior courthouse , a small 2-story stone building , still stands on the property . 

It was used as a jail after the present courthouse was built but is now closed .
