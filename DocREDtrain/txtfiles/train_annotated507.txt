The Mungana affair involved the sale to the Government of Queensland , Australia , in 1922 , of some mining properties in the Chillagoe - Mungana districts of northern Queensland , at a grossly inflated price . 

At that time , Ted Theodore was Premier of Queensland and William McCormack , Member for Cairns and a former Speaker of the Legislative Assembly of Queensland , 

In 1927 Theodore entered Federal politics , while McCormack became Premier of Queensland from 1925 to 1929 . 

In 1929 the Queensland Government appointed a Royal Commission to investigate the sale . 

The Commission found that at the time of the sale in 1922 , Theodore and McCormack each secretly held 25 % ownership of the properties sold . 

In July 1930 , the scandal forced Theodore to resign from his role as Treasurer of Australia . 

McCormack had already resigned from Queensland Parliament in February 1930 before the adverse findings by the Royal Commission . 

The Queensland Government did not charge either man with any offence .
