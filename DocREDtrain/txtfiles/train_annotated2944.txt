The General Motors J platform , or J - body , is an automobile platform that was used by General Motors from 1981 to 2005 . 

Marking the transition to front - wheel drive in the compact - car segment in North America , the J platform was the successor to the H platform , making it the third generation of compact cars designed by the company . 

Outside North America , the J platform was adopted by GM - controlled subsidiaries making the same transition to front - wheel drive , though as a mid - size car . 

By 1990 , General Motors began to reduce its usage of the J platform , reducing its usage of badge engineering . 

As the company prepared the launch of the Saturn S - Series for 1990 , Buick and Oldsmobile ended their use of the J platform . 

Outside of North America , the J platform was phased out in favor of the GM2900 platform ( cars based upon the Opel Vectra ) . 

With its highest sales under the Chevrolet and Pontiac brands , the J platform remained in production into the 2000s , following several redesigns . 

Replaced by the GM Delta platform , General Motors ended production of the J - platform in June 2005 , with a Pontiac Sunfire as the final example .
