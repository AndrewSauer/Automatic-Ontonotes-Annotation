I Am a Camera is a 1955 British comedy - drama film based on The Berlin Stories by Christopher Isherwood and the eponymous play by John Van Druten . 

The film is a fictionalized account of Isherwood 's time living in Berlin between the World Wars . 

Directed by Henry Cornelius , from a script by John Collier , I Am a Camera stars Laurence Harvey as Isherwood and Julie Harris recreating her Tony Award - winning performance as Sally Bowles . 

The film was critically unsuccessful upon its release in both the United Kingdom and the United States , and it was subjected to restrictive ratings . 

Long overshadowed by Cabaret , the 1966 stage and 1972 film adaptation of the same source material , contemporary critics have noted the historic interest of this earlier presentation .
