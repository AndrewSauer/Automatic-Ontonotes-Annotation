The Tudor Barn is a large brick barn in Eltham in the Royal Borough of Greenwich . 

It was built in 1525 by William Roper . 

The Ropers lived next door in a manor house in the centre of a moat for several years . 

William married Margaret More , the daughter of Thomas More , and one of the most learned women of sixteenth - century England . 

It is a Grade II * listed building ( as Well Hall Art Gallery ) . 

The west end of the Tudor Barn was mostly occupied by servants , as can be seen by the two huge chimneys there . 

However , the barn was also used for storage . 

It can be seen on old maps that the moat was directly connected to the Tudor Barn by a bridge . 

Edith Nesbit , author of The Railway Children and co - ounder of the Fabian Society , lived in a house in the grounds of the Tudor Barn from 1899 to 1921 . 

The Tudor Barn was refurbished in the 1930s . 

The Woolwich Borough Council then decided that they would use the newly renovated barn as the centrepiece of a new park , which is known as Well Hall Pleasaunce . 

The park opened in 1933 , and three years later an art gallery was opened on the ground floor of the barn . 

This was not the council 's original intention , however ; they wanted a library and museum in the Tudor Barn , but these never materialised . 

For years after the Second World War , the barn contained the art gallery , a restaurant and a room for weddings and events in the upstairs space .
