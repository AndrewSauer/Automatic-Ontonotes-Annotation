Frank Stone ( 22 August 1800 â€“ 18 November 1859 ) was an English painter . 

He was born in Manchester , and was entirely self - taught . 

He was elected an Associate of the Society of Painters in Water Colours in 1833 and Member in 1843 ; and an Associate of the Royal Academy in 1851 . 

The works he first exhibited at the Academy were portraits , but from 1840 onwards he contributed figure pictures , scenes from Shakespeare , scripture and sentimental subjects , many of which were engraved . 

In 1850 he led the opposition within the Academy to the innovations of the Pre - Raphaelite Brotherhood , having already criticised their work in the previous year . 

When Dante Gabriel Rossetti wrote a very critical review of Stone 's work in return , Stone launched an outright assault on Pre - Raphaelitism , initiating the controversy that engulfed the movement . 

Leading Pre - Raphaelite William Holman Hunt later depicted a print of one of Stone 's works in the background of his painting The Awakening Conscience . 

It has been suggested that this was intended as an insult , since the furniture of the room was supposed to represent the bad taste of the characters depicted . 

According to William Powell Frith , Stone was a loyal friend , but very argumentative , " No fair - weather friend was he , but true as steel when friendly countenance might be sorely needed . 

Still , I confess there were drawbacks to the enjoyment of Stone 's society . 

It was enough for anyone to advance an opinion for Stone to differ from it . " 

He was the father of the painter Marcus Stone who illustrated many works by Charles Dickens ( the Stones were Dickens ' neighbours for many years ) and himself produced a frontispiece for an edition of Martin Chuzzlewit . 

He also had a daughter , Ellen Stone .
