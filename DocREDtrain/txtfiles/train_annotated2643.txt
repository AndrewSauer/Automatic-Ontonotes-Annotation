Uematsu , a self - taught musician , began playing the piano at the age of twelve , with English singer - songwriter Elton John as his biggest influence . 

Uematsu joined Square in 1986 , where he first met Final Fantasy creator Hironobu Sakaguchi . 

The two later worked together on many titles at the company , most notably in the Final Fantasy series . 

After nearly two decades with Square , Uematsu left in 2004 to create his own production company , which included the Dog Ear Records music label . 

He has since composed music as a freelancer for other games , including ones developed by Square Enix and Sakaguchi 's development studio , Mistwalker . 

Many soundtracks and arranged albums of Uematsu 's game scores have been released . 

Pieces from his video game works have been performed in various Final Fantasy concerts , where he has worked with Grammy Award - winning conductor Arnie Roth on several of these performances . 

From 2002 to 2010 , he was in a hard rock band with Square Enix colleagues Kenichiro Fukui and Tsuyoshi Sekito called The Black Mages , in which he played electronic organ and other keyboards . 

The band played various arranged rock versions of Uematsu 's Final Fantasy compositions . 

He has since performed with Earthbound Papas , which he formed as the successor to The Black Mages in 2011 .
