Standard Oil Co. Inc. was an American oil producing , transporting , refining , and marketing company . 

Established in 1870 by John D. Rockefeller and Henry Flagler as a corporation in Ohio , it was the largest oil refinery in the world of its time . 

Its history as one of the world 's first and largest multinational corporations ended in 1911 , when the United States Supreme Court , in a landmark case , ruled that Standard Oil was an illegal monopoly . 

Standard Oil dominated the oil products market initially through horizontal integration in the refining sector , then , in later years vertical integration ; the company was an innovator in the development of the business trust . 

The Standard Oil trust streamlined production and logistics , lowered costs , and undercut competitors . 

" Trust - busting " critics accused Standard Oil of using aggressive pricing to destroy competitors and form a monopoly that threatened other businesses . 

Rockefeller ran the company as its chairman , until his retirement in 1897 . 

He remained the major shareholder , and in 1911 , with the dissolution of the Standard Oil trust into 34 smaller companies , Rockefeller became the richest man in the world , as the initial income of these individual enterprises proved to be much bigger than that of a single larger company . 

Its successors such as ExxonMobil or Chevron are still among the companies with the largest income worldwide . 

By 1882 , his top aide was John Dustin Archbold . 

After 1896 , Rockefeller disengaged from business to concentrate on his philanthropy , leaving Archbold in control . 

Other notable Standard Oil principals include Henry Flagler , developer of the Florida East Coast Railway and resort cities , and Henry H. Rogers , who built the Virginian Railway .
