Make Way for Tomorrow is a 1937 American drama film directed by Leo McCarey . 

The plot concerns an elderly couple ( Victor Moore and Beulah Bondi ) who are forced to separate when they lose their house and none of their five children will take both parents . 

The film was written by Vi√±a Delmar , from a play by Helen and Noah Leary , which was in turn based on the novel The Years Are So Long by advice columnist Josephine Lawrence . 

McCarey believed that it was his finest film . 

When he accepted his Academy Award for Best Director for The Awful Truth which was released the same year , he said " Thanks , but you gave it to me for the wrong picture . " 

In 2010 , it was selected for preservation by the United States Library of Congress 's National Film Registry .
