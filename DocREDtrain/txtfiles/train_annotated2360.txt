The people of Chipilo are called chipile√±os in Spanish , or cipilegni in Venetian . 

Chipilo was founded on October 2 , 1882 , by immigrants from the northern Italian region of Veneto . 

Most came from the town of Segusino and other surrounding towns in the province of Treviso . 

These immigrants arrived in Mexico in search of fertile land , leaving behind the poverty that was plaguing Veneto at that time . 

Most of them took up cattle raising , and the dairy products of Chipilo became famous in Puebla and other regions in central Mexico . 

Some maintain a derived Venetian dialect ( part of Venetian language ) . 

In 1982 , the townspeople of Chipilo celebrated the 100th anniversary of the foundation of the city along with visitors from the Veneto region . 

In this celebration the city of Segusino , Italy , was declared Chipilo 's Twin city .
