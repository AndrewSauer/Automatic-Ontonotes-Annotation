Mehri or Mahri is a member of the Modern South Arabian languages , a subgroup of the Semitic branch of the Afroasiatic family . 

It is spoken by the Mehri tribes , who inhabit isolated areas of the eastern part of Yemen and western Oman , particularly the Al Mahrah Governorate . 

Mehri and its sister Modern South Arabian languages were spoken in the southern Arabian Peninsula before the spread of Arabic along with Islam in the 7th century CE . 

It is today also spoken by Mehri residents in Qatar and the United Arab Emirates , as well as in Kuwait by guest workers originally from South Arabia . 

Given the dominance of Arabic in the region over the past 1400 years and the frequent bilingualism with Arabic among Mehri speakers , Mehri is at some risk of extinction . 

It is primarily a spoken language , with little existing vernacular literature and almost no literacy in the written form among native speakers .
