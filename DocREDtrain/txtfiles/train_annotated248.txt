East Midlands Parkway railway station is located north of Ratcliffe - on - Soar on the Midland Main Line in the East Midlands of England . 

It provides park and ride facilities for rail passengers on the routes from to and . 

It is also the closest station to East Midlands Airport , some away , which is reached by an hourly minibus service . 

All train services are operated by East Midlands Trains ( EMT ) . 

The station lies in southwest Nottinghamshire , about from the border with Leicestershire and from that with Derbyshire , between the stations at , and . 

When it opened , there was a little - used shuttle bus from the station to the airport , but this ceased not long afterwards . 

An hourly minibus service was re - introduced in 2015 . 

The main station building and the 850-vehicle car park are to the west of the line , opposite Ratcliffe - on - Soar Power Station . 

Road access is via the A453 , which provides a link to the nearby ( three - minute drive ) M1 motorway . 

The Midland Main Line is not electrified north of Bedford ; therefore , all services are operated by diesel trains . 

This was set to change by 2019 , when a scheme to electrify the remainder of the line had been due to be completed . 

This , along with increased line speeds , would have meant that the station would have been under 80 minutes from the capital . 

However , the electrification scheme was put ' on hold ' in the early summer of 2015 .
