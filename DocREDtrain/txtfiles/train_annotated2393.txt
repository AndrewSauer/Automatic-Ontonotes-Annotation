Edward Mandell House ( July 26 , 1858 – March 28 , 1938 ) was an American diplomat , politician , and an adviser to President Woodrow Wilson . 

He was known by the nickname Colonel House , although he had performed no military service . 

He was a highly influential back - stage politician in Texas before becoming a key supporter of the presidential bid of Wilson in 1912 . 

Having a self - effacing manner , he did not hold office but was an " executive agent " , Wilson 's chief advisor on European politics and diplomacy during World War I ( 1914 – 18 ) and at the Paris Peace Conference of 1919 . 

In 1919 Wilson , suffering from a series of small strokes , broke with House and many other top advisors , believing they had deceived him at Paris .
