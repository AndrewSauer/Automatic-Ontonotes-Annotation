Valeri Danilov ( also spelled : Valeriy ; Russian:Валерий Дмитриевич Данилов ) is a Russian military historian and a retired officer ( Colonel ) . 

Danilov has Candidate of History Sciences degree ( кандидат исторических наук ) and is a professor at the Academy of Military Science . 

In 1993 , Yuri Gorkov and Valeri Danilov published a previously classified document , called Considerations to the plan of the strategic development of the armed forces of the Soviet Union , ( dating back to May 15 , 1941 ) which proposed a strike on Germany . 

Allegedly , it was composed by Georgy Zhukov and Semyon Timoshenko and presented to Joseph Stalin . 

The publishing of this plan initiated a longer discussion among the Russian historian over Stalin 's actual strategy in 1941 . 

Contrary to many historians both within Russia and the West ( David Glantz ) , Valeri Danilov has argued that - taking into account the concentration of power to Stalin 's hand - it is highly implausible , that the Soviet defense commissar and the chief of staff could have prepared such a document without Stalin 's authorization . 

Considering the 1937 purges of the higher officers , it is hardly possible that staff officers would have risked antagonised official Soviet policy . 

Danilov suggests - and he is supported by Mikhail Meltyukhov , Vladimir Nevezhin and others - that this draft by Zhukov was actually basis for Soviet military planning in 1941 .
