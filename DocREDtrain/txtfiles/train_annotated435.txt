Torke ( Kannada ತೊರ್ಕೆ ) is a small village in Kumta taluk of Uttara Kannada district , Karnataka , India . 

This village is about a few square kilometres in extent . 

Torke traditionally is the amalgamation of Hoskatt , Naranapur , Toregazani , Torke , Devarabhavi , Hallergudi , Devana and Gonehalli . 

It has a Gram Panchayat . 

The name " Torke " is supposed to have originated from " tore " , the rivulet that used to flow through the village . 

Local names like " torehalla " and " toregazani " also give credence to this theory . 

However , since this place is famous for production of salt , and a salt maker is also known to be called a " thoreya " in Kannada , Torke might also have got its name from that .
