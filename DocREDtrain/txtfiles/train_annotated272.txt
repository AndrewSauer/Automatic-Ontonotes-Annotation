, usually abbreviated as Sankyū ( 参急 ) , was a private railway company that operated in Nara Prefecture and Mie Prefecture , Japan for 14 years from 1927 to 1941 , when it merged with its parent company , Ōsaka Electric Railroad ( Daiki ) . 

Sankyū built a single train line which serviced the cities of Sakurai , Nabari , Matsusaka , and Ujiyamada , and the company acquired a second major line as well as a small local line from Ise Electric Railway ( Iseden ) . 

These lines extended northwards from Matsusaka through cities in Mie Prefecture along the coast of Ise Bay as far as Kuwana . 

The infrastructure of Sankyū is now owned by Kintetsu and remains in use today . 

Sankyū 's main goal was to build a portion of a railway to Ujiyamada ( now Ise ) which is home to Ise Grand Shrine , the holiest Shinto shrine in Japan and a common pilgrimage destination . 

The word " Sangū " is a kanji abbreviation of a phrase in Japanese that roughly translates to " a pilgrimage to Ise Grand Shrine " . 

Sankyū 's line connected with a line originating in Osaka owned by its parent company , Daiki , and together the two offered direct rail service from Osaka to Ujiyamada on a line that was much more direct than that of its main rival , Kokutetsu . 

When Sankyū acquired Iseden , it then set its eyes on a direct connection between Osaka and Nagoya .
