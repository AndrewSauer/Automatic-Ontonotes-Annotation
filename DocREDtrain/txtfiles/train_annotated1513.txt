Old Glory is a nickname for the flag of the United States . 

The original " Old Glory " was a flag owned by the 19th - century American sea captain William Driver ( March 17 , 1803 â€“ March 3 , 1886 ) , who flew the flag during his career at sea and later brought it to Nashville , Tennessee , where he settled . 

Driver greatly prized the flag and ensured its safety from the Confederates , who attempted to seize the flag during the American Civil War . 

After the war , Driver 's daughter and niece feuded over which of them owned the original Old Glory . 

In 1922 , both flags claimed to be the original " Old Glory " became part of the collection of the Smithsonian Institution , where they remain at the National Museum of American History .
