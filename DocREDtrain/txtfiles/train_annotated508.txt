Doublehead ( 1744 – 1807 ) or Incalatanga ( Tal - tsu'tsa in Cherokee ) , was one of the most feared warriors of the Cherokee during the Cherokee – American wars . 

In 1788 , his brother , Old Tassel , was chief of the Cherokee people , but was killed under a truce ( negotiating peace ) by frontier rangers . 

In 1791 Doublehead was among a delegation of Cherokees who visited U.S. President George Washington in Philadelphia . 

After the peace treaty at the Tellico Blockhouse in 1794 , Doublehead served as one of the leaders of the Chickamauga Cherokee ( or " Lower Cherokee " ) . 

Upon the death of his nephew , Principal Chief John Watts , in 1802 , Doublehead was chosen as leader of the Chickamauga ( taking on the title Chuqualataque ) .
