New Armenian Resistance ( NAR ) was an Armenian militant group known since 1977 which has been responsible for bombings in Belgium , France , Italy and Switzerland . 

The main targets were Turkish , Soviet , British , and Israeli travel agencies . 

The New Armenian Resistance first struck in 1977 , detonating a bomb in the Turkish tourism office in Paris . 

Subsequent attacks targeted Turkish banks in Brussels and London , and airline counters in Brussels and Rome . 

Following the bombing of Turkish Airlines offices in Brussels in February 1983 , NAR either ceased its operations entirely or perhaps combined with a larger group such as the ASALA . 

Little is known about the founders and the leaders of the organization . 

It has been hypothesized that NAR may in fact be an arm of the Armenian Secret Army for the Liberation of Armenia ( ASALA ) for some of its European operations .
