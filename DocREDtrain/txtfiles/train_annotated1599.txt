In Francoist Spain between 1936 and 1947 , concentration camps were created and coordinated by the Servicio de Colonias Penitenciarias Militarizadas . 

The first concentration camp was created by Francisco Franco on July 20 1936 and was located in the castle of El Hecho in Ceuta . 

The last concentration camp , located at Miranda del Ebro , was closed in 1947 . 

Inmates of these concentration camps were republican ex - combatants of the Spanish Republican Army , Spanish Republican Air Force or the Spanish Republican Navy , as well as political dissidents , homosexuals , and regular convicts . 

From 1940 , the supervisor of these camps was the general Camilo Alonso Vega . 

The main function of the camps was to detain Republican prisoners of war . 

Those who were regarded as " unrecoverable " were shot . 

The prisoners were used as forced labourers for reconstruction works ( Belchite ) , to mine coal , extract mercury , build highways and dams , and dig canals . 

Furthermore , thousands were used in the construction of the Carabanchel Prison ( Madrid ) , in the Arco de la Victoria ( Madrid ) and in the Valley of the Fallen ( Cuelgamuros ) . 

Later their work was subcontracted to private companies and lawnowners , who used them to improve their properties .
