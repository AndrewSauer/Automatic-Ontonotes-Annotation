Bolgatty Palace is a former palace built by the Dutch in India on Bolgatty Island in Kochi , Kerala . 

One of the oldest existing Dutch palaces outside Holland , this quaint mansion was built in 1744 by Dutch traders and later extended and gardens were landscaped around it . 

The building was then the Governor 's palace for the commander of Dutch Malabar , and in 1909 was leased to the British . 

It served as the home of the British governors , being the seat of the British Resident of Cochin during the British Raj . 

In 1947 , when India attained independence , the palace became the property of the state and was converted into a heritage hotel resort .
