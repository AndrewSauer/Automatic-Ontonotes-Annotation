The Reivers : A Reminiscence , published in 1962 , is the last novel by the American author William Faulkner . 

The bestselling novel was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction in 1963 . 

Faulkner previously won this award for his book A Fable , making him one of only three authors to be awarded it more than once . 

Unlike many of his earlier works , it is a straightforward narration and eschews the complicated literary techniques of his more well known works . 

It is a picaresque novel , and as such may seem uncharacteristically lighthearted given its subject matter . 

For these reasons , The Reivers is often ignored by Faulkner scholars or dismissed as a lesser work . 

He previously had referred to writing a " Golden Book of Yoknapatawpha County " with which he would finish his literary career . 

It is likely that The Reivers was meant to be this " Golden Book " . 

The Reivers was adapted into a 1969 film directed by Mark Rydell and starring Steve McQueen as Boon Hogganbeck .
