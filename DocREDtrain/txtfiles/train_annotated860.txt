River of Dreams is the twelfth studio album by American singer - songwriter Billy Joel , released on August 10 , 1993 . 

He stopped recording new music as a performer after this album although he has subsequently released live albums and composed the music for an instrumental album performed by Hyung - ki Joo . 

River of Dreams presented a much more serious tone from Joel than found in his previous albums , dealing with issues such as trust and long - lasting love . 

It was rumored that the themes of trust and betrayal , particularly certain lyrics from the songs " A Minor Variation " and " The Great Wall of China " , stem from Joel 's legal disputes with his former manager and ex - brother - in - law , Frank Weber , who reportedly embezzled millions of dollars from Joel and used dubious accounting practices to cover it up . 

The album cover was a painting by Joel 's then - wife , Christie Brinkley . 

In 1993 , Rolling Stone gave the Top Picks award for " The Best Album Cover of the Year " . 

The music video for the title track has over 20 million views on YouTube as of April 6 , 2018 .
