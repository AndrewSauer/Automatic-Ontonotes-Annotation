The Piano Lesson is a 1987 play by American playwright August Wilson . 

It is the fourth play in Wilson 's The Pittsburgh Cycle . 

Wilson began writing this play by playing with the various answers regarding the possibility of " acquir[ing ] a sense of self - worth by denying one 's past " . 

The Piano Lesson received the 1990 Pulitzer Prize for Drama . 

A Romare Bearden painting , The Piano Lesson , inspired Wilson to write a play featuring a strong female character to confront African - American history , paralleling Troy in earlier Fences . 

However , on finishing his play , Wilson found the ending to stray from the empowered female character as well as from the question regarding self - worth . 

What The Piano Lesson finally seems to ask is : " What do you do with your legacy , and how do you best put it to use ? " 

Set in 1936 Pittsburgh during the aftermath of the Great Depression , The Piano Lesson follows the lives of the Charles family in the Doaker Charles household and an heirloom , the family piano , which is decorated with designs carved by an enslaved ancestor . 

The play focuses on the arguments between a brother and a sister who have different ideas on what to do with the piano . 

The brother , Boy Willie , is a sharecropper who wants to sell the piano to buy the land ( Sutter 's land ) where his ancestors toiled as slaves . 

The sister , Berniece , remains emphatic about keeping the piano , which shows the carved faces of their great - grandfather 's wife and son during the days of their enslavement .
