Thomas Wolsey ( c. March 1473 – 29 November 1530 ; sometimes spelled Woolsey or Wulcy ) was an English churchman , statesman and a cardinal of the Catholic Church . 

When Henry VIII became King of England in 1509 , Wolsey became the King 's almoner . 

Wolsey 's affairs prospered , and by 1514 he had become the controlling figure in virtually all matters of state and extremely powerful within the Church , as Archbishop of York , a cleric in England junior only to the Archbishop of Canterbury . 

His appointment in 1515 as a cardinal by Pope Leo X gave him precedence over all other English clerics . 

The highest political position Wolsey attained was Lord Chancellor , the King 's chief adviser ( formally , as his successor and disciple Thomas Cromwell was not ) . 

In that position , he enjoyed great freedom and was often depicted as an alter rex ( other king ) . 

After failing to negotiate an annulment of Henry 's marriage to Catherine of Aragon , Wolsey fell out of favour and was stripped of his government titles . 

He retreated to York to fulfill his ecclesiastical duties as Archbishop of York , a position he nominally held , but had neglected during his years in government . 

He was recalled to London to answer to charges of treason — a common charge used by Henry against ministers who fell out of favour — but died on the way from natural causes .
