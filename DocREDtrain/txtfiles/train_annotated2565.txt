Smilacaceae , the greenbrier family , is a family of flowering plants . 

Up to some decades ago the genera now included in family Smilacaceae were often assigned to a more broadly defined family Liliaceae , but for the past twenty to thirty years most botanists have accepted Smilacaceae as a distinct family . 

It is considered that the two families diverged around 55 millions years ago during the Early Paleogene possibly near the boundary between Paleocene and Eocene . 

One characteristic that distinguishes Smilacaceae from most of the other members of the Liliaceae - like Liliales is that it has true vessels in its conducting tissue . 

Another is that the veins of the leaves , between major veins , are reticulate ( net - shaped ) , rather than parallel as in most monocots .
