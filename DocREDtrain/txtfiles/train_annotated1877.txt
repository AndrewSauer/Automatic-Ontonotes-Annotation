The Brenner Base Tunnel (; ) is a planned railway tunnel through the base of the Eastern Alps beneath the Brenner Pass . 

It will run from near Innsbruck , in Austria , to Fortezza , in Italy , replacing part of the current Brenner railway . 

The line is part of Line 1 , the Berlin to Palermo route , of Trans - European Transport Networks ( TEN - T ) . 

The Brenner Pass , in the Alps at the border between Austria and Italy , is one of the most important traffic connections between northern and southern Europe , and the motorway going over it is infamous for its frequent traffic jams . 

Pollution from this traffic is a major concern . 

The hope is to relieve this situation by greatly improving the railway connection between North Tyrol and South Tyrol with the new tunnel , which will allow trains to cross the Alps much faster . 

Currently , speeds in the Brenner region barely exceed due to the steepness of the existing tracks , which cross the pass at an elevation of 1,371 metres above sea level . 

The travel time from Innsbruck to Bolzano will be reduced from 2 hours to 50 minutes . 

The project is funded by Austria and Italy , and a contribution by the European Union . 

Due to the magnitude of the project ( it will be the world 's second - longest tunnel , after the Gotthard Base Tunnel ) , the funding promised so far will not suffice for the estimated costs . 

The tunnel was scheduled to be completed in 2025 .
