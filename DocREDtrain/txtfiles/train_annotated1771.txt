William Julius Mickle ( 29 September 1734 in Langholm , in Dumfrieshire   – 28 October 1788 in Forest Hill ) was a Scottish poet . 

Son of the minister of Langholm , Dumfriesshire , he was for some time a brewer in Edinburgh , but failed . 

He moved to England where he worked as a corrector for the Clarendon Press at Oxford . 

In 1771 – 75 Mickle lodged at the manor house in Forest Hill , Oxfordshire . 

Mickle had various literary failures and minor successes until , while at Forest Hill , he produced his translation of the Lusiad , from the Portuguese of Luís de Camões . 

This was a success that brought him both fame and money . 

In 1777 he went to Portugal , where he was received with distinction . 

In 1784 he published the ballad of Cumnor Hall , which suggested to Scott the writing of Kenilworth . 

He is perhaps best remembered , however , by the beautiful lyric , " There 's nae luck aboot the Hoose " , which , although claimed by others , is almost certainly his . 

In 1781 Mickle married Mary Tomkins , the daughter of his former landlord in Forest Hill , and settled in Wheatley . 

He died in 1788 while on a visit to his in - laws , and is buried in Forest Hill churchyard .
