Ugadi ( Ugādi , Samvatsarādi , Yugadi ) is the New Year 's Day for the people of Andhra Pradesh , Telangana and Karnataka states in India . 

It is festively observed in these regions on the first day of the Hindu lunisolar calendar month of Chaitra . 

This typically falls in March or April of the Gregorian calendar . 

The day is observed by drawing colorful patterns on floor called kolamulus ( Telugu : Muggulu , Kannada : Rangoli ) , mango leaf decorations on doors called toranalu ( Kannada : Torana ) , buying and giving gifts such as new clothes , giving charity to the poor , special bath followed by oil treatment , preparing and sharing a special food called pachadi , and visiting Hindu temples . 

The pachadi is a notable festive food that combines all flavors – sweet , sour , salty , bitter .
