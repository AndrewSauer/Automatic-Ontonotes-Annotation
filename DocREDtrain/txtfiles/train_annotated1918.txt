The Bidet was a type of small horse from France , now extinct . 

It was a landrace developed principally in the area around Brittany , Morvan , Auvergne , Poitou , and Burgundy . 

It stood about 110â€“135 centimetres at the withers . 

Two distinct groups are documented , which were bred in a semi - feral state . 

Bidets were first identified in the 15th century . 

They were used as " jack - of - all - trades " animals , equally suited for riding , farm work and passenger transport . 

They declined during the 19th century , when railways and better - kept roads pressured horse breeders into specialising their breeds . 

Despite the animal 's disappearance , the name " bidet " survives in several French cultural references .
