" The Light In Our Soul " , an up - tempo ballad , was the second single from the album My Number One by 2005 Eurovision winner Helena Paparizou . 

The song was written by Costas Bigalis and was chosen for the Eurovision Greek National Final , along with " O.K. " 

and " Let 's Get Wild , " but it was " My Number One " that was chosen . 

The song was disqualified because it was revealed that a CD demo version of the song sung by another artist had been leaked on the internet and oddly made available for sale on the site of a popular e - tailer . 

Paparizou herself stated during a concert in Chicago Illinois that " The Light in Our Soul " was leaked on the internet , and the song was therefore disqualified from the Eurovision preselection . 

She then made a very jovial comment regarding internet file - sharing in general saying : " No no , I do not use the internet . 

This is why we do n't like the internet . "
