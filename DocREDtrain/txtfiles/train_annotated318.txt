Ozu and screenwriter K≈çgo Noda wrote the script in 103 days , loosely basing it on the 1937 American film , Make Way for Tomorrow , directed by Leo McCarey . 

Noda suggested adapting the film , which Ozu had not yet seen . 

Ozu used many of the same cast and crew members that he had worked with for years . 

Released in Japan in 1953 , it did not immediately gain international recognition and was considered " too Japanese " to be marketable by Japanese film exporters . 

It was screened in London in 1957 where it won the inaugural Sutherland Trophy the following year , and received praise from US film critics after a 1972 screening in New York City . 

Tokyo Story is widely regarded as Ozu 's masterpiece and is often cited as one of the greatest films ever made . 

In 2012 , it was voted the best film of all time in a poll of film directors by Sight & Sound magazine .
