The Chaco National Park ( ) is a national park of Argentina , located in the province of Chaco . 

It has an area of 150   km . 

It was created in 1954 in order to protect a sample of the Eastern Chaco , composed mainly of warm lowlands , with an annual summer rainfall between 750 and 1,300   mm . 

This park is a protected area for the quebracho trees . 

Forests of quebracho colorado chaqueño ( Schinopsis balansae ) were once located in the north of Santa Fe and the western half of Chaco , and had entered the northeast region of the province of Corrientes . 

Its strong wood and its abundant tannin caused it to be over - exploited for a century . 

The area harbors several environments : scrubland , savanna , swamps , and small lakes . 

The scrubland is the habitat of the red quebracho ( Schinopsis lorentzii ) , white quebracho ( Aspidosperma quebracho - blanco ) , algarrobo ( Prosopis alba ) , and lapacho ( Tabebuia spp . 

) , all of which are commercially valuable species . 

The fauna includes large predators such as cougars . 

In the lakes one finds yacare caimans and capybaras . 

Elsewhere there are armadillos , South American tapirs and plains viscachas , as well as birds ( more than 340 species ) . 

The fauna also includes the black howler monkey ( Alouatta caraya ) . 

Indigenous communities of the Mocoví and Toba peoples are found in the protected area .
