Ferdinando Sanfelice ( 1675 â€“ 1 April 1748 ) was an Italian late Baroque architect and painter . 

Sanfelice was born in Naples and died there . 

He was one of the principal architects in Naples in the first half of the 18th century . 

He was a student of Francesco Solimena . 

Sanfelice was known primarily for temporary displays and his secular architecture . 

The former involved displays such as those set up for royal visits and births as well as for religious celebrations ; the latter included a large number of family dwellings in Naples , including his own Palazzo Sanfelice , built between 1723 and 1728 , and the Palazzo Serra di Cassano , finished around 1730 . 

Most notable in Sanfelice 's architecture are the staircases ; rather than being incidental features set off to the side of a courtyard , he gave them central and prominent positions so that they became important architectural features in their own right , often as double staircases . 

Sanfelice also worked on churches in Naples , including San Lorenzo Maggiore , San Giovanni a Carbonara , and the chapel of the Nunziatella at the Nunziatella military academy
