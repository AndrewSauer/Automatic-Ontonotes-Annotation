Buḍḍhacarya (; ) , dharma name Upaseṇo (; ) , born as Kiaw Chokchai (; ) , and commonly known as Somdet Kiaw (; " His Holiness Kiaw " ) , was a Thai prelate who was the abbot of Wat Saket and the Acting Supreme Patriarch of Thailand , the effective leader of all Buddhist monks in Thailand . 

He was appointed Acting Supreme Patriarch in 2005 due to the failing health of the incumbent Supreme Patriarch Nyanasamvara Suvaddhana . 

He was a monk of the Mahanikaya order , and is of Thai Chinese descent . 

His appointment provoked severe criticism from Luang Ta Maha Bua ( of the Dhammayuttika Nikaya order ) and Sondhi Limthongkul , who claimed that the appointment created two Supreme Patriarchs and contravened the royal prerogative of King Bhumibol Adulyadej . 

On 4 March 2005 , Maha Bua even petitioned King Bhumibol Adulyadej to remove all of Kiaw 's royal titles .
