Reading is a popular pastime in North Korea , where literacy and books enjoy a high cultural standing , elevated by the regime 's efforts to disseminate propaganda as texts . 

Because of this , writers are held in high prestige . 

The partition of Korea following the Second World War led to a considerable cross - border movement , which included writers moving from North to South or from South to North . 

North Korea 's subsequent literary tradition was shaped and controlled by the State . 

The " Guidelines for Juche Literature " , published by the official Choson Writers ' Alliance ( ) , emphasised that literature must extoll the country 's leader , Kim Il - sung , and , later , Kim Jong - il . 

Only members of the Writers ' Alliance are authorised to have their works published .
