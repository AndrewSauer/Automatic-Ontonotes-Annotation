Görece is a village in the Menderes district of Izmir Province , Turkey . 

It is known for its production of eye beads . 

Today , the real eye beads are produced only in Görece and Kurudere ( Kemalpaşa ) villages near Izmir by a handful of craftsmen , who have devoted their lives to this art . 

The 3000-year - old antique Mediterranean glass art lives in these eye bead furnaces with its every detail . 

The roots of the very few glass masters who still practise this age - old tradition goes back to the Arab artisans , who have settled in Izmir and its towns during the decline of the Ottoman Empire by the end of 19th century . 

The glass art that has lost its glamour in Anatolia , combining with the eye sign , was relived . 

The masters who practised their arts at Araphan and Kemeraltı , districts of İzmir , were exiled due to the smoke emissions from their furnaces and fire risks to the neighbourhood .
