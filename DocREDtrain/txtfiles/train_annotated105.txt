The genesis of modern understanding of Greek mythology is regarded by some scholars as a double reaction at the end of the 18th century against " the traditional attitude of Christian animosity mixed with disdain , which had prevailed for centuries " , in which the Christian reinterpretation of myth as a " lie " or fable had been retained . 

In Germany , by about 1795 , there was a growing interest in Homer and Greek mythology . 

In GÃ¶ttingen Johann Matthias Gesner began to revive Greek studies and a new humanistic spirit . 

His successor , Christian Gottlob Heyne , worked with Johann Joachim Winckelmann , and laid the foundations for mythological research both in Germany and elsewhere . 

Heyne approached the myth as a philologist and shaped the educated Germans ' conception of antiquity for nearly half a century , during which ancient Greece exerted an intense influence on intellectual life in Germany .
