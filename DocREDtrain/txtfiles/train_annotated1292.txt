The National Peasants ' Party ( Partidul Național Țărănesc or PNȚ ) was a Romanian political party , formed in 1926 through the fusion of the Romanian National Party ( ) from Transylvania and the Peasants ' Party ( ) from the prewar kingdom . 

It was in power for most of the time between 1928 and 1933 with longtime leader Iuliu Maniu as prime minister . 

A moderately conservative party , with some left - wing corporatist views ( supporting , for instance , voluntary cooperative farming ) , it remained staunchly pro - monarchy . 

A former member , Corneliu Coposu , claimed that 270,000 PNȚ members were sent to prisons and work camps , where three quarters of them perished , beginning in 1947 when the party was banned by the Communist government following the Tămădău Affair . 

Both party president Iuliu Maniu and deputy leader Ion Mihalache died in prison during the Communist regime . 

Former PNȚ members Corneliu Coposu and Ion Rațiu founded a new party in December 1989 under the name Christian Democratic National Peasants ' Party ( , PNȚCD or PNȚcd ) . 

It was the first officially registered political party after the fall of Communism .
