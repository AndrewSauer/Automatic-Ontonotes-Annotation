The Temple of Jupiter Feretrius ( Latin : Aedes Iuppiter Feretrius ) was the first temple ever built in Rome ( the second was Etruscan and became known as the Temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus ) . 

Its site is uncertain but is thought to have been on the Capitoline Hill . 

It was said to have been dedicated to the god Jupiter by Romulus after his defeat of Acro , king of the Ceninensi , in 752 - 751 BC . 

The origin of the epithet ' Feretrius ' is unclear and may relate to one of two Latin verbs - ' ferire ' ( making it mean ' he who strikes ' , since the spolia opima was offered there ) or ' ferre ' ( making it mean ' he to whom [ the spolia opima ] are brought ' ) . 

According to Cornelius Nepos , by the middle years of the first century BC the temple had lost its roof after many years of neglect . 

As a result , the emperor Augustus decided to rebuild it on the suggestion of Titus Pomponius Atticus , the wealthy equestrian most famous for being the friend and confidant of Cicero . 

Augustus subsequently included the temple in his autobiography , the Res Gestae Divi Augusti , within the list of monuments and temples in Rome that he paid to have rebuilt . 

If still in use by the 4th - century , it would have been closed during the persecution of pagans in the late Roman Empire .
