The Melado is a river of Linares province , Maule Region , of Chile . 

It rises in the " Cordillera de los Andes " with the name of river Guaiquivilo where it is formed by two tributaries , the river Cajón Troncoso , born near the Argentine border and the river Palaleo , from the outflow of Dial lake , located some 70   km upstream from the joining of the two rivers . 

The Guaiquivilo flows northwardly along a typical interandean longitudinal valley . 

On its left bank the Guaiquivilo is flanked by the Melado sierra , which has peaks that often surpass 2.500 mt and which constitute a natural barrier between the Guaiquivilo basin and those of the rivers Longaví , Achibueno and Ancoa , all tributary of the river Loncomilla , which , in its turn , is the main tributary of river Maule . 

On its right bank , the Guaiquivilo is joined by the river San Pedro or La Puente which is born from a glacier related to the San Pedro ( or Las Yeguas ) volcano . 

From this point onwards , the river takes the name of Melado . 

The river Melado is dammed to generate hydroelectric power in the Pehuenche Hydroelectric Plant . 

The Melado joins the river Maule when the latter has already flowed for 75   km . 

The Canal Melado transports water from the Melado river through the Guaiquivilo basin and a tunnel of 4,2   km to the Ancoa River .
