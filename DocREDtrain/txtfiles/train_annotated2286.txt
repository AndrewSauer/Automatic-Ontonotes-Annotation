Emily Murphy ( born Emily Gowan Ferguson ; 14 March 186827 October 1933 ) was a Canadian women 's rights activist , jurist , and author . 

In 1916 , she became the first female magistrate in Canada , and in the British Empire . 

She is best known for her contributions to Canadian feminism , specifically to the question of whether women were " persons " under Canadian law . 

Murphy is known as one of " The Famous Five " ( also called " The Valiant Five")â€”a group of Canadian women 's rights activists that also included Henrietta Muir Edwards , Nellie McClung , Louise McKinney and Irene Parlby . 

In 1927 , the women launched the " Persons Case , " contending that women could be " qualified persons " eligible to sit in the Senate . 

The Supreme Court of Canada ruled that they were not . 

However , upon appeal to the Judicial Committee of the British Privy Council , the court of last resort for Canada at that time , the women won their case . 

However , there has been some criticism of her later work , mainly for her role in the Sexual Sterilization Act of Alberta and her allegations that a ring of immigrants from other countries , particularly China , would corrupt the white race by getting Canadians hooked on drugs . 

In her book The Black Candle , she wrote : " It is hardly credible that the average Chinese peddler has any definite idea in his mind of bringing about the downfall of the white race , his swaying motive being probably that of greed , but in the hands of his superiors , he may become a powerful instrument to that end .
