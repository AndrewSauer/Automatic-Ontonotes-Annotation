Sofia 's Diary is a drama that is shown online through the social networking site Bebo , which is the same site that hosts KateModern . 

A version of Sofia 's Diary originally came out in 2003 in Portugal . 

This means it actually predates the first video of lonelygirl15 which came out in 2006 . 

Sofia is played by 22-year - old Rachel Hyde - Harvey . 

Sofia 's Diary was the second internet based show to make the transition to UK TV ( Tiscali Showcase on C4 being the first in 2007 ) following its acquisition by Channel Five ( from Sony Pictures Television International ) on 17 April 2008 . 

The first two seasons of the show were broadcast on ' Fiver ' ( previously ' Five Life ' ) . 

Following an 8-month break , Sofia 's Diary returned to Bebo to begin a 6-week third season , from 29 May 2009 . 

This season differs to the first two , in that new episodes are only being shown on Tuesdays and Fridays , as opposed to every weekday . 

Sure Girl originally sponsored Sofia 's Diary . 

Season 3 of the show is being exclusively sponsored by Transport for London ( TfL ) , to help increase awareness among teenagers of its road safety campaign .
