France was the last ship of the s , the first dreadnoughts built for the French Navy . 

She was completed just before World War I as part of the 1911 naval building programme . 

She spent the war in the Mediterranean , covering the Otranto Barrage in the Adriatic . 

France , accompanied by her sister ship , was sent to the Black Sea in 1919 to oppose the Bolsheviks during the Russian Civil War . 

Her crew briefly mutinied in April 1919 from a combination of war - weariness , Communist sympathizers in the crew and difficult conditions . 

The mutiny and general lack of morale among her crew caused her to return to France later that month . 

Striking an uncharted rock off the French coast in 1922 , she foundered four hours later .
