Christine Mayr - Lumetzberger ( born 1956 in Linz , Austria ) is a teacher and former Benedictine nun who was excommunicated from the Roman Catholic Church when she and six others were ordained as priests by an Independent Catholic bishop in 2002 , she called herself a Roman Catholic priest , and she refused to recant . 

She was ordained a bishop in 2003 along with Gisela Forster ; reportedly , the ordination was performed by Roman Catholic bishops whose identity remains a secret . 

She has declared as her motive to promote the ordination of women within the Roman Catholic Church which does not recognize the ordination of women as valid : " A baptized male alone receives sacred ordination validly " . 

In 1994 , Pope John Paul II declared in the apostolic letter Ordinatio sacerdotalis that " the Church has no authority whatsoever to confer priestly ordination on women " .
