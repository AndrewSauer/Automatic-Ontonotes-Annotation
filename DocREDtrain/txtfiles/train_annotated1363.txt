The Chaser APEC pranks were a series of comic stunts that targeted the Asia - Pacific Economic Cooperation ( APEC ) Leaders Summit ( 2â€“9 September 2007 ) , in Sydney , Australia . 

They were coordinated and performed by the Australian satire group The Chaser for the television series The Chaser 's War on Everything . 

The most prominent prank was the breach of an APEC restricted zone in the heart of Sydney central business district on 6 September . 

Julian Morrow directed a fake Canadian motorcade , which was allowed through the restricted zone by police and not detected until Chas Licciardello alighted , dressed as Osama bin Laden . 

Although pranks that involved public locations , figures , and organisations were always a feature of the series , the APEC pranks yielded unprecedented local and international publicity , both positive and negative . 

Some team members faced charges for breaching the APEC zone , but these were dropped because police had allowed their entry into the restricted zone . 

Other less controversial and less publicised stunts were also shown on The Chaser 's War on Everything , with ratings peaking at almost three million Australian viewers for the APEC wrap - up episode .
