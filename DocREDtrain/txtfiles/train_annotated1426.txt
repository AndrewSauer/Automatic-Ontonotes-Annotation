Wulsbüttel is a village and a former municipality in the district of Cuxhaven , in Lower Saxony , Germany . 

Since 1 January 2014 , it is part of the municipality Hagen i m Bremischen . 

Wulsbüttel belonged to the Prince - Archbishopric of Bremen , established in 1180 . 

In 1648 the Prince - Archbishopric was transformed into the Duchy of Bremen , which was first ruled in personal union by the Swedish Crown - interrupted by a Danish occupation ( 1712 – 1715 ) - and from 1715 on by the Hanoverian Crown . 

In 1807 the ephemeric Kingdom of Westphalia annexed the Duchy , before France annexed it in 1810 . 

In 1813 the Duchy was restored to the Electorate of Hanover , which - after its upgrade to the Kingdom of Hanover in 1814 - incorporated the Duchy in a real union and the Ducal territory , including Wulsbüttel , became part of the new Stade Region , established in 1823 .
