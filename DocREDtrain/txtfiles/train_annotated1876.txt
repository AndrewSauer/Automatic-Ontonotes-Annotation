The Table Rock Welcome Centre ( also known as Table Rock Centre and formerly as Table Rock House ) is a retail and observation complex located in Niagara Falls , Ontario , Canada at the brink of the Canadian Horseshoe Falls , several hundred feet south of the former rock formation which bears its name . 

The complex consists of two buildings connected by an indoor pedestrian mall and anchored by " The Grand Hall " , a multi - level indoor observation complex , completed in 2008 . 

The north building , originally constructed in 1926 , houses a first - floor retail store and the Welcome Centre , Niagara 's Fury , a whitewater simulation , plus the ticket offices for the tunnels Journey Behind the Falls attraction . 

The upper level contains multiple specialty stores , a currency exchange , and additional outdoor observation plaza . 

The south building , constructed in 1974 , has a first - floor fast food snack bar , additional retail space , and a second - floor , semi - formal restaurant overlooking the Horseshoe Falls and the upper Niagara River . 

Owned and operated by the Niagara Parks Commission , Table Rock Centre provides the best direct path from the Horseshoe Falls observation area to the Falls Incline Railway ( courtesy of a new bridge constructed in 2008 spanning the Niagara Parkway ) , which transports passengers to the Fallsview Tourist Area above the Niagara Escarpment .
