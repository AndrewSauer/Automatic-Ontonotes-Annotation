The Victorian Gay and Lesbian Rights Lobby ( VGLRL ) is the peak lobby group in Victoria , Australia for the attainment of equality , human rights and social justice for the entire Gay , Lesbian , Bisexual , Transgender and Intersex ( GLBTI ) community . 

VGLRL was created in October 1997 , following presentation of a report to a public meeting which proposed a model for a Victorian Gay and Lesbian Rights Lobby . 

This model was accepted , and 21 days later the Lobby held its first annual general meeting , elected a management committee , adopted the rules of association , and began the process of incorporation . 

VGLRL has worked on a variety of issues such as domestic partnerships , access to in vitro fertilisation and adoption , and an end to homophobic violence . 

In 2009 , it criticized the application of the instruction Concerning the Criteria for the Discernment of Vocations with regard to Persons with Homosexual Tendencies in view of their Admission to the Seminary and to Holy Orders in Australian dioceses . 

VGLRL also initiated the national Equal Love campaign , in an effort to win marriage rights for Australian gay and lesbian couples .
