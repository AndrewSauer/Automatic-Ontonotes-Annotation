Hans Achim Litten ( 19 June 1903 â€“ 5 February 1938 ) was a German lawyer who represented opponents of the Nazis at important political trials between 1929 and 1932 , defending the rights of workers during the Weimar Republic . 

During one , Litten subpoenaed Adolf Hitler , to appear as a witness , where Litten then cross - examined Hitler for three hours . 

Hitler was so rattled by the experience that , years later , he would not allow Litten 's name to be mentioned in his presence . 

In retaliation , Litten was arrested on the night of the Reichstag fire along with other progressive lawyers and leftists . 

Litten spent the rest of his life in one German concentration camp or another , enduring torture and many interrogations . 

After five years and a move to Dachau , where his treatment worsened and he was cut off from all outside communication , he committed suicide . 

A number of memorials to him exist in Germany , but Litten was largely ignored for decades because his politics did not fit comfortably in either the west or the communist postwar propaganda . 

Not until 2011 was Litten finally portrayed in the mass media , when the BBC broadcast The Man Who Crossed Hitler , a television film set in Berlin in summer 1931 .
