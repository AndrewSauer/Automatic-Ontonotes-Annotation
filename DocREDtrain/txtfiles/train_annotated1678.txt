" Lazy " is the fourth single from the album Coming Up by Suede , released on April 7 , 1997 , on Nude Records . 

It was also the fourth single from the album to reach the top ten , peaking at number nine . 

The video for the song was directed by Pedro Romhanyi , who previously made videos for the band 's songs , " Animal Nitrate " , " Beautiful Ones " and " Saturday Night " . 

The rather abstract clip features mostly slow motion shots of the band relaxing inside a bedsit , as singer Brett Anderson peers through a tiny gap in the floorboards into his neighbour 's apartment . 

At one point in the video , keyboardist Neil Codling is seen laughing as a he feeds a mushroom to some goldfish before confronting Brett Anderson with a mirror he positions in a way which shows their faces combining as one . 

" Lazy " was produced by Ed Buller , while the additional B - side tracks were by Bruce Lampcov . 

The song " Digging a Hole " on CD2 was written and performed solo by keyboard player Neil Codling on lead vocals , although is still credited as Suede .
