The Stephen Phillips House is a historic house and museum located in the McIntire Historic District in Salem , Massachusetts , United States and was designed by Samuel McIntyre . 

Phillips House began with Elias Hasket Derby , one of America 's first self - made millionaires from the sea trade . 

When he died in 1799 , his daughter , Elizabeth and her husband , Captain Nathaniel West , inherited his farm in Danvers , Massachusetts . 

They built a country house on the property , sparing little expense . 

A grand estate was in the making . 

In 1806 , shortly after the house was completed , a divorce forced Nathaniel off the property . 

After Elizabeth died in 1814 , the house was left to her three daughters . 

When one of the daughters died in 1819 , Nathaniel inherited one - third of the estate . 

He proceeded to move four rooms to Salem , the museum 's present location . 

At that time , he added a hallway , a third floor , and a back ell section . 

In 1911 , Stephen W. Phillips bought the house , moving in with five generations of family furnishings . 

He lived in the house until his death in 1955 . 

The house remains as it was at that time , containing an eclectic collection representing the Phillips 's extensive travels . 

The Phillips House is now owned and operated as a historic house museum by Historic New England and is open for public tours . 

The house was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1983 .
