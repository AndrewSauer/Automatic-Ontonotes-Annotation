The Michener Award is one of the highest distinctions in Canadian journalism . 

The award was founded in 1970 by Roland Michener , who was Governor General of Canada at the time , and his wife Norah . 

The idea for the award was developed in 1969 with Bill MacPherson , then president of the National Press Club and managing editor of the Ottawa Citizen , who remained a secretary of the committee administering the award until his death . 

Since 1970 , the Michener Award has been presented yearly by the Governor General at Rideau Hall to a Canadian news organization " whose entry is judged to have made a significant impact on public policy or on the lives of Canadians " . 

Although the award is presented to media organizations rather than individual journalists , five individuals of the nominated finalists are invited to the award ceremony so that their contributions can also be acknowledged . 

Since 1987 , the Michener Foundation also awards annually the Michener - Deacon Fellowship , which provides financial support to a journalist wishing to complete a project that serves the Canadian public interest . 

The fellowship is named in honor of Roland Michener and late journalist Paul Deacon .
