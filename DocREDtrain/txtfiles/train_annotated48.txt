" Goodbyeee " , or " Plan F : Goodbyeee " , is the sixth and final episode of the British historical sitcom Blackadders fourth series , entitled Blackadder Goes Forth . 

The episode was first broadcast on BBC1 in the United Kingdom on 2 November 1989 , shortly before Armistice Day . 

Apart from the one - off short film made a decade later , it was the last episode of Blackadder to be produced and transmitted . 

The episode depicts its main characters ' final hours before a British offensive on the Western Front of the First World War , and Captain Blackadder 's attempts to escape his fate by feigning madness ; after he fails to convince General Melchett , and Field Marshal Haig 's advice proves useless , he resigns himself to taking part in the push . 

Goodbyeee has a darker tone than other episodes in the series , culminating in its acclaimed ending in which the main characters are assumed to die in machine - gun fire . 

The episode 's theme of death ties in with the series ' use of gallows humour , its criticism and satire of war , and its depiction of authority figures contentedly sending their subordinates to face the enemy , while unwilling to do so themselves . 

Richard Curtis and Ben Elton wrote the episode , and further material was provided by cast members . 

Its final sequence , which shows the main characters going " over the top " , uses slow motion , as the programme 's creators were unhappy with the result of the scripted ending . 

The enhanced scene has been described as bold and highly poignant .
