Mark Hollis is the only solo album by the former Talk Talk frontman Mark Hollis . 

It was released on Polydor Records on 26 January 1998 , then reissued on Pond Life on 13 March 2000 . 

In 2003 , the album was released in LP format on Universal Records . 

Its sound is noted for being extremely sparse and minimal ; AllMusic called it " quite possibly the most quiet and intimate record ever made " . 

Hollis found inspiration not in the popular music of the day , but rather in 20th - century classical music and jazz from the late fifties and sixties . 

The album did not mark a return for Hollis to the music industry or live performance : he stated at the time of the album 's release that " There wo n't be any gig , not even at home in the living room . 

This material is n't suited to play live . " 

The album was recorded as part of a two - album contract with Polydor , along with Talk Talk 's 1991 Laughing Stock . 

At one point , the record was to be entitled Mountains of the Moon before it was decided to be self - titled ( an early promotional cassette of the album features the original title ) . 

Engineer Phill Brown , who also recorded Laughing Stock , stated that , compared to the final Talk Talk album , which he considered " one of [ his ] best projects " but " dark and claustrophobic " , he found the solo release " the opposite â€¦ - open , restful and at times fantastically beautiful " . 

On 11 October 2011 , Ba Da Bing Records released Mark Hollis on vinyl . 

This marks the first time that the album has been issued on vinyl in the US .
