Prince William Pitt Leleiohoku II ( 1854 – 1877 ) , was a poet and composer of many Hawaiian mele ( songs ) , mostly love songs . 

He was the youngest of the Na Lani Ehā ( " Royal Four " ) , which included his sisters Queen Liliuokalani ( 1838 – 1917 ) and Princess Miriam Likelike ( 1851 – 1887 ) and his brother King David Kalākaua ( 1836 – 1891 ) . 

Leleiohoku and his siblings are credited with the musical revival enjoyed by Hawaiians during the last half of the 19th century . 

Many of his compositions adapted folk tunes of visiting merchants , sailors , and foreign settlers . 

Liliuokalani said that Leleiohoku had a talent for composition " really in advance " of herself and Likelike . 

He founded the Kawaihao Singing Club and soon he and his colleagues were winning most of the royal song club competitions . 

Many claimed that he had one of the best male voices among native Hawaiians .
