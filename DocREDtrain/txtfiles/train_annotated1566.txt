The United States Army Security Agency ( ASA ) was the United States Army 's signals intelligence branch . 

The Latin motto of the Army Security Agency was Semper Vigiles ( Vigilant Always ) , which echoes the declaration , often misattributed to Thomas Jefferson , that " " The Agency existed between 1945 and 1976 and was the successor to Army signals intelligence operations dating back to World War I. ASA was under the operational control of the Director of the National Security Agency ( DIRNSA ) , located at Fort Meade , Maryland ; but had its own tactical commander at Headquarters , ASA , Arlington Hall Station , Virginia . 

Besides intelligence gathering , it had responsibility for the security of Army communications and for electronic countermeasures operations . 

In 1977 , the ASA was merged with the US Army 's Military Intelligence component to create the United States Army Intelligence and Security Command ( INSCOM ) .
