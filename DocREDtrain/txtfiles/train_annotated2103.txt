Rasovi ( poglavice , knezovi ) was the unofficial name given originally to five extremely influential Ustaše who returned from exile to Zagreb in April 1941 with their leader Ante Pavelić . 

They were Eugen Kvaternik , Ante Moskov , Vilko Pečnikar , Ivo Herenčić and Erih Lisak . 

When Pavelić became leader ( Poglavnik ) of the Independent State of Croatia ( Croatian : Nezavisna Država Hrvatska , NDH ) they retained his respect and trust as fellow émigrés , and he appointed them to senior government positions in which they were able to operate with extensive autonomy . 

Later Eugen Kvaternik sided with his father Slavko Kvaternik in a conflict with Pavelić and fell into disfavour . 

The " Rasovi " were thus reduced to four , who were then joined by three powerful Ustaša colonels - Vjekoslav " Maks " Luburić , Vjekoslav Servatzy and Rafael Boban . 

The " Rasovi " were extremists , generally mistrusted - sometimes feared - by members of the Domobranstvo ( home guard ) . 

They were certainly feared by many in the NDH civilian population , particularly Serbs but also those in the smaller Roma and Jewish minorities . 

The Rasovi and their followers were responsible for many of the atrocities perpetrated by the Ustaša regime in the period 1941 - 1945 .
