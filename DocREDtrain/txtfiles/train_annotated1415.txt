The Niagara Regional Council is the governing body of the Regional Municipality of Niagara in Ontario , Canada . 

Council meets at Niagara Region Headquarters in Thorold , Ontario . 

The council consists of a regional chair , the mayors of all twelve Niagara Regional municipalities , and eighteen additional regional councillors elected to represent the various municipalities . 

Councillors are elected to four year terms , with the next election to be held in October 2018 . 

Unlike municipal councils within the Niagara Region , the regional chair is elected by regional council , and not directly by residents of the region . 

Any elector within the Niagara Region may be elected chair by council , although regional policy requires that the regional chair will be elected from among the 30 persons who have been elected to regional council in the just completed municipal elections . 

Once elected , the regional chair must resign her / his seat as a councillor representing a municipality . 

That municipality council then determines how the replacement councillor will be chosen .
