The Assumption of the Virgin , 1475 - 1476 , is a large ( 228.6 x 377.2   cm ) painting in tempera on wood panel by Francesco Botticini . 

It portrays Mary 's assumption and was commissioned as the altarpiece for a church in Florence and is now in the National Gallery , London . 

The disciples gather around Mary 's lily - filled tomb with looks of amazement . 

There are donor portraits of Matteo Palmieri , who commissioned the work , kneeling on the left , and his wife on the right . 

In Heaven above , surrounded by the nine choirs of angels , Jesus raises his hand in blessing to his kneeling mother . 

Among the lesser angels around Jesus and Mary are saints . 

Together with Palmieri 's poem La città di vita , this mixing of saints with angels raised questions about the orthodoxy of the donor Palmieri , and possibly that of the painter Botticini himself .
