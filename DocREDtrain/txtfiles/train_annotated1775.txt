The strains in Ghana – Togo relations stretch back to pre - independence days . 

After 1918 , following the defeat of Germany , the League of Nations divided the German colony of Togoland from north to south , a decision that divided the Ewe people among the Gold Coast , British Togoland , and French Togoland . 

After 1945 , the United Nations took over the Togoland mandates . 

During the 1950s , when the independence of Ghana was in sight , demands grew for a separate Ewe state , an idea that Kwame Nkrumah , leader of the Gold Coast independence movement , opposed . 

Following a UN plebiscite in May 1956 , in which a majority of the Ewe voted for union with Ghana , British Togoland became part of the Gold Coast . 

After Togolese independence in 1960 , relations between Togo and Ghana deteriorated , aggravated by political differences and incidents such as smuggling across their common border . 

At times , relations have verged on open aggression . 

The result of the transfer of Togoland to Ghana has meant that many Togolese keep one foot on either side of the border , living in Ghana by night and working in the markets of the capital , Lomé , by day .
