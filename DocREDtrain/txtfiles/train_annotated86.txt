Richard Msowoya is a Malawian politician who has been Speaker of the National Assembly of Malawi since 2014 . 

Msowoya served as Deputy Minister of Education in Bingu wa Mutharika 's cabinet but he resigned following the introduction of the controversial ' equitable ' selection of students into Malawian public higher education institutions , dubbed , ' the quota ' system which , presumably , disenfranchises capable students from more populous and intellectually more gifted districts . 

He was elected as a member of the National Assembly on 20 May 2014 , and on 16 June 2014 he was elected as Speaker of the National Assembly , receiving 101 votes against 89 for Francis Kasaila . 

He was also the running mate of Lazarus Chakwera , the Malawi Congress Party 's presidential candidate in the May 2014 general elections .
