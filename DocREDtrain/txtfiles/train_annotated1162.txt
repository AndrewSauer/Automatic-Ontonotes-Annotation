Southwood is a national park in Queensland , Australia , 288   km west of Brisbane . 

Brigalow - belah forest remnants are conserved in this park on the western Darling Downs . 

Few intact examples of this vegetation type remain on the Downs . 

Cypress pine , poplar box , wilga bush , false sandalwood , western teatree and other plant species common throughout the semi - arid lands also grow in the park . 

Southwood ’s scrubby forests are a refuge for wildlife . 

More than 92 species of birds have been seen in the park . 

The wonga pigeon is close to the inland limit of its range here . 

Large depressions known as gilgais are scattered through the park . 

These form by constant wetting and drying of the heavy clay soils . 

This is the traditional land of the Bigambul people . 

Explorers Allan Cunningham and Thomas Mitchell passed this way but the surrounding area was slow to attract settlers . 

Formerly known as " Wild Horse Paradise " , Southwood became a national park in 1970 .
