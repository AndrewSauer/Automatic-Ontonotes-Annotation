Strawhead is a play by American writers Norman Mailer and Richard Hannum about Marilyn Monroe . 

The play is an adaptation of Mailer 's 1980 book Of Women and Their Elegance , an imagined memoir told in Monroe 's voice . 

Strawhead takes place in New York City during the last few days of Monroe 's life in August 1962 . 

During this period , she is alone with her memories , most of which revolve around her time living in New York City . 

The play is primarily composed of a collection of imagined interviews , that never took place , between Monroe and Mailer during Monroe 's last hours . 

The play made its off - Broadway debut in January 1986 , with Mailer 's wife Norris Church in the cast and his daughter Kate Mailer in the role of Monroe . 

Kate Mailer also appeared on the April 1986 cover of Vanity Fair as the Monroe character in Strawhead .
