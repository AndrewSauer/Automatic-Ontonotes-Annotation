The Fu River , or Fuhe ( ) , is a river in China 's Jiangxi province . 

Its basin occupies most of the Fuzhou prefecture of Jiangxi . 

The Fu River has it origin on the northwestern slopes of the Wuyi Mountains , from where it flows in the general north - northwestern and northwestern direction . 

Via a network of smaller lakes and channels in Nanchang prefecture , the waters of the Fuhe eventually reach the Poyang Lake , to which it is one of the major tributaries , along with the Gan River ( which flows from the south / southwest ) and a number of smaller rivers coming from the east and west . 

As the Poyang Lake drains into the Yangtze , the Fu River is part of the Yangtze Basin as well .
