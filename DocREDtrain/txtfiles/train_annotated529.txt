The Church of the Presidents is a former Episcopal chapel on the Jersey Shore where seven United States presidents worshiped . 

It was visited by presidents Chester A. Arthur , James Garfield , Ulysses S. Grant , Benjamin Harrison , Rutherford Hayes , William McKinley , and Woodrow Wilson . 

All except Grant were in office when they paid their visits to the church . 

For approximately 75 years it was a seasonal summer resort church , located at 1260 Ocean Avenue in Long Branch , Monmouth County , New Jersey , United States , just across the street from the Atlantic Ocean . 

In 1953 the Episcopal Diocese deconsecrated the church and slated it for demolition . 

Local preservationists stepped in and in 1955 the old chapel was rededicated as the Long Branch Historical Museum . 

Today the building is undergoing extensive structural repairs and renovations . 

It is closed to the public .
