" November Spawned a Monster " is a song by Morrissey . 

It was released as a single in 1990 . 

It was written by Morrissey and Clive Langer . 

It also features one of Morrissey 's former colleagues from The Smiths , Andy Rourke . 

In reaching number 12 in the British chart it was a marked improvement over Morrissey 's previous single , " Ouija Board , Ouija Board " , but still failed to chart as high as the singer 's first four releases . 

The track is one of Morrissey 's personal favourites , and has been played live many times by the singer . 

It along with its b - side " He Knows I 'd Love to See Him " appears on the compilation album Bona Drag . 

The song tackles the plight of the disabled , an unusual subject matter for a pop single . 

As ever with Morrissey the tone and sentiments are riddled with ambiguity . 

His use of words such as ' monster ' and ' twisted ' creates a strange mix of revulsion , sympathy and black comedy , all used to enlighten , and disturb , the audience . 

By forcing the ambivalent persona of tormentor and saviour , Morrissey forces the listener to confront their own prejudices head on . " 

The song is quoting Les Chants de Maldoror ( Chant 2 , verse 7 ) , in which a hermaphrodite perceives himself as a monster and dreams of love . 

In November 2014 Alex Broun 's play November Spawned a Monster , inspired by Morrissey 's song , premiered at The Old Fitzroy , in Sydney , Australia , directed by Robert Chuter ( director ) and starring James Wright .
