Church Street is a main north - south running street in the city of Wollongong , New South Wales , Australia . 

It contains many of Wollongong 's well known and lesser known attractions and historic sites . 

To the north it runs from the northern high rise district west of the harbour through apartments and flats and then down Smith 's Hill , up Church Hill and down to the mall , see Wollongong Central . 

At the summit of Church Hill is the site of St Michael 's Anglican Pro - Cathedral . 

At the mall a portion runs for pedestrian only use ( though this is currently up for debate as to whether cars should be let back in limited amounts and times on Crown Street , the street running through the mall east - west ) and then turns back to traffic along a section of light density commerce and residence for just over a kilometre . 

For the first half of this there is a long car park within the street , used often by mall shoppers and people watching games at local WIN Stadium a few blocks to the east , due to no cost parking . 

On the west side of this section is MacCabe Park ( often mis - spelt McCabe ) , a local park with a playground and youth centre . 

South of this the street goes through residential areas to the immediate southern suburb of where it ends at J.J. Kelly Park , a local sporting venue , also used on occasion by circuses for tent sites .
