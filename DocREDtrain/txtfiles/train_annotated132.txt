The Pylon Assemblage is an accreted terrane of igneous rocks in southwestern British Columbia , Canada , located about north of Vancouver . 

It is named after Pylon Peak , a summit of the Mount Meager massif . 

Two units make up the Pylon Assemblage , although the youngest unit comprises nearly 100 % of the assemblage . 

On the southern flank of Pylon Peak , the oldest unit consists of andesitic lava flows . 

It locally overlies The Devastator Assemblage and older basal breccia . 

Porphyritic plagioclase andesite of the youngest unit underlies much of the southern and western portions of Meager . 

Devastator Peak , a volcanic plug at the southern end of the Meager massif , was the source for these lava flows between 1,000,000   and 500,000   years ago . 

The Pylon Assemblage represents the largest geological formation comprising Meager .
