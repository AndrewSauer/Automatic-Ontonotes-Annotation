The Bahamas Bowl is a NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision college football bowl game played annually in Nassau , Bahamas , at the 15,000-seat Thomas Robinson Stadium . 

The first game , played in 2014 , was the first major ( FBS or historical equivalent ) bowl game to be played outside the United States and Canada between two U.S. teams since the January 1 , 1937 , Bacardi Bowl in Havana , Cuba . 

That first inaugural game featured teams from the Mid - American Conference and Conference USA . 

That conference matchup has continued annually , through the December 2017 playing of the game . 

From its inception to 2017 , the game was sponsored by the Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen restaurant franchise and officially known as the Popeyes Bahamas Bowl . 

After Restaurant Brands International acquired Popeyes in 2017 , they declined to renew sponsorship . 

Elk Grove Village , Illinois—"home to the largest industrial park in the United States "— picked up the sponsorship in 2018 , renaming the bowl as the Makers Wanted Bahamas Bowl .
