Alberta has experienced a relatively high rate of growth in recent years , due in large part to its economy . 

Between 2003 and 2004 , the province saw high birthrates ( on par with some larger provinces such as British Columbia ) , relatively high immigration , and a high rate of interprovincial migration when compared to other provinces . 

Approximately 81 % of the population live in urban areas and only about 19 % live in rural areas . 

The Calgary â€“ Edmonton Corridor is the most urbanized area in Alberta and is one of Canada 's four most urban regions . 

Many of Alberta 's cities and towns have also experienced high rates of growth in recent history . 

From a population of 73,022 in 1901 , Alberta has grown to 3,645,257 in 2011 and in the process has gone from less than 1.5 % of Canada 's population to 10.9 % .
