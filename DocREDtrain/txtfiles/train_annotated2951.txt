The Capture of Jericho occurred between 19 and 21 February 1918 to the east of Jerusalem beginning the Occupation of the Jordan Valley during the Sinai and Palestine Campaign of the First World War . 

Fighting took place in an area bordered by the Bethlehem – Nablus road in the west , the Jordan River in the east , and north of a line from Jerusalem to the Dead Sea . 

Here a British Empire force attacked Ottoman positions , forcing them back to Jericho and eventually across the Jordan River . 

Winter rains put an end to campaigning after the advance from the Gaza – Beersheba line to the capture of Jerusalem in December 1917 . 

This lull in the fighting offered the opportunity for the captured territories to be consolidated . 

Extensive developments were also required along the lines of communication to ensure that front - line troops were adequately supplied , approximately from their main bases at Moascar and Kantara on the Suez Canal . 

General Edmund Allenby 's initial strategic plans focused on his open right flank . 

If attacked with sufficiently large forces , he could be outflanked by an attack from the east — unlike his left flank which rested securely on the Mediterranean Sea to the west . 

His aim was to capture the territory east of Jerusalem stretching to the Dead Sea , where his right flank could be more secure . 

The area was garrisoned by Ottoman troops entrenched on hill - tops which the British infantry , Australian light horse and New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigades attacked . 

The infantry captured Talat ed Dumm on the main Jerusalem to Jericho road , while the light horse and mounted rifle brigades captured Jericho and the area to the south bordered by the Jordan River and the Dead Sea .
