Major General Craig A. Franklin is a retired United States Air Force general officer . 

He was last the commander of 3rd Air Force , based at Ramstein Air Base in Germany . 

A 1981 graduate of the United States Air Force Academy , Franklin served in flying assignments , instructor pilot assignments , as well as multiple staff assignments . 

Franklin has commanded a test and evaluation group and three wings , including the 332nd Air Expeditionary Wing based at Balad Air Base , Iraq . 

Franklin submitted his retirement to be effective 31 January 2014 . 

His early retirement resulted in a reduction in retirement rank to the two - star rank of major general . 

This is as a direct result of Franklin 's dismissal of a sexual assault case in February 2013 after the officer in question , a lieutenant colonel , had been found guilty at a court martial in November 2012 . 

The officer was subsequently released from prison and restored to his rank , only to be forced into retirement at a lower rank after the discovery of further sexual misconduct . 

In a statement Franklin said , " he was retiring ' for the good of this command and the Air Force ' because of persistent doubts about his impartiality in overseeing sex - abuse investigations . "
