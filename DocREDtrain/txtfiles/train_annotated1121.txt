Genshin ( 源信 ; 942 – July 6 , 1017 ) , also known as Eshin Sozu , was the most influential of a number of Tendai scholars active during the tenth and eleventh centuries in Japan . 

He was not a wandering evangelist as Kūya was , but was an elite cleric who espoused a doctrine of devotion to Amida Buddha which taught that because Japan was thought to have entered mappō , the " degenerate age " of the " latter law , " the only hope for salvation lay in the reliance on the power of Amitabha . 

Other doctrines , he claimed , could not aid an individual because they depended on " self - power " ( jiriki ) , which can not prevail during the chaos of the degenerate age , when the power of another ( tariki ) is necessary . 

In his approach to rebirth in the Pure Land , Genshin emphasized visual meditation practices , where later Pure Land sects favored verbal recitations such as the nembutsu . 

Genshin 's doctrine is documented in his magnum opus , the , which in later copies of the text came complete with graphic depictions of the joy of the blessed and the suffering of those doomed to chaos . 

Genshin 's influence in contemporary Japanese culture today is primarily due to his treatise , Ōjōyōshū , particularly the graphic descriptions of the Buddhist hell realms ( 地獄 jigoku ) , which inspired a genre of horror and morality stories . 

The 1960 Japanese film Jigoku was influenced by Genshin 's Ōjōyōshū among other works . 

In Jodo Shinshu Buddhism , he is considered the Sixth Patriarch . 

Genshin is credited as the founder of the Enshin school of Tendai Buddhism , and for espousing the " original enlightenment " teaching , or hongaku ( 本覚 ) , where one is originally enlightened , but unaware of it . 

In all , Genshin left more than 30 works which continue to influence Pure Land thought today . 

The image of Amida Nyorai in the main building of Yasaka - ji Temple in Shikoku is said to have been made by Genshin in the Heian Period .
