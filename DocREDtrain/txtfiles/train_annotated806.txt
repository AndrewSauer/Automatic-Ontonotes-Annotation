The Spirits Book ( Le Livre des Esprits in original French ) is part of the Spiritist Codification , and is regarded as one of the five fundamental works of Spiritism . 

It was published by the French educator Allan Kardec on April 18 , 1857 . 

It was the first and remains the most important spiritist book , because it addresses in first hand all questions developed subsequently by Allan Kardec . 

The book is structured as a collection of questions regarding the origin of the spirits , the purpose of the life , the order of the universe , evil and good and the afterlife . 

Its answers , according to Kardec , were given to him by a group of spirits who identified themselves as " The Spirit of Truth " , with whom he communicated in several Spiritist sessions during the 1850s . 

Kardec , who considered himself an " organizer " rather than an author , grouped the questions and their answers by theme , occasionally including lengthier digressions the spirits had dictated to him on specific subjects , some signed by philosophers such as Augustine of Hippo and Thomas Aquinas and writers including Voltaire .
