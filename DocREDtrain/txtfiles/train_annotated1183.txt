Léon Louis Rostan ( 17 March 1790 – 4 October 1866 ) was a French internist and a member of the Académie Nationale de Médecine . 

Rostan was born in Saint - Maximin - la - Sainte - Baume , and studied medicine in Marseilles and Paris . 

He was a disciple of Philippe Pinel ( 1745 – 1826 ) , and for much of his professional career was associated with the Salpêtrière Hospital in Paris . 

In 1819 Rostan was the author of Recherches sur le ramollissement du cerveau ( Researches on cerebral softening ) , in which he provided the first accurate description of spontaneous cerebral softening . 

He documented that the disorder was a specific anatomo - clinic entity that was different from encephalitis and apoplexy . 

His findings were harshly criticised by followers of Broussais ' teachings on physiological medicine , who claimed that brain softenings were the result of an inflammation process , and therefore should be depicted as encephalitis . 

He also did extensive research of animal magnetism and somnambulism , and wrote a treatise on charlatanism for his graduate thesis . 

Rostan performed early studies on the classification of body types , using descriptive terms such as respiratory - cerebral , muscular and digestive in his analysis . 

In 1845 , he was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences .
