The Madrassa of Al - Nasir Muhammad is a madrassa and mausoleum located in the Bayn al - Qasrayn region of Cairo , Egypt . 

Part of the larger Qalawun complex , it was built in the name of the Mamluk sultan Al - Nasir Muhammad ibn Qalawun , but its construction began in 1296 under the reign of Sultan Al - Adil Kitbugha , who was sultan in between Al - Nasir Muhammad 's first and seconds reigns .
