The Zlatni Rat , often referred to as the Golden Cape or Golden Horn ( translated from the local Chakavian dialect ) , is a spit of land located about west from the harbour town of Bol on the southern coast of the Croatian island of Brač , in the region of Dalmatia . 

It extends southward into the Hvar Channel , a body of water in the Adriatic Sea between the islands of Brač and Hvar , which is home to strong currents . 

The landform itself is mostly composed of a white pebble beach , with a Mediterranean pine grove taking up the remainder . 

Zlatni Rat has been regularly listed as one of the top beaches in Europe . 

Its distinctive shape can be seen in many travel brochures , which made it one of the symbols of Croatian tourism .
