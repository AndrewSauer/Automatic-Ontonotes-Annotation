Rachel 's Challenge is an organization in the United States that works to reduce violence . 

It is a non - religious , non - profit , non - political organization , led by Darrell Scott and his wife Sandy . 

Rachel Scott was the first student killed in the Columbine High School shooting in 1999 . 

Darrell Scott , Rachel 's father , established Rachel 's Challenge to perpetuate his daughter 's example and the two - page " Code of Ethics " she wrote a month before her death at the hands of the perpetrators of the Columbine High School shooting , Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold . 

This code of ethics had included the words : " Compassion is the greatest form of love humans have to offer " , and Darrell Scott has stated his belief in this message forms the basis for what he both speaks at public appearances , and has written as an author . 

The Rachel ’s Challenge presentations are given in schools and communities by members of her family and other speakers , using video footage of the Columbine High School massacre and its aftermath , combined with Rachel Scott ’s drawings and writings , in a campaign to quell school violence , bullying , and teen suicide . 

As of 2009 , Rachel 's Challenge has developed a team of 30 speakers addressing young people in schools and colleges worldwide about Rachel 's example . 

The Rachel 's Challenge program includes establishing Friends of Rachel clubs in schools , following the initial presentation , to sustain the campaign 's goals on a long - term basis . 

Schools around the country have incorporated Rachel 's challenge into their own clubs bringing the message to their students .
