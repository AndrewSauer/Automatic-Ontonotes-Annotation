The Royal School is a public mixed Grammar school located in Dungannon , County Tyrone , Northern Ireland . 

It was one of a number of ' free schools ' created by James I in 1608 to provide an education to the sons of local merchants and farmers during the plantation of Ulster . 

Originally set up in Mountjoy near Lough Neagh in 1614 , it moved to its present location in 1636 . 

It was founded as a boys school but became coed in 1986 when the school amalgamated with the Dungannon High School for Girls . 

It has four ' sister ' schools , The Royal School , Armagh in Armagh , County Armagh , The Portora Royal School in Enniskillen , County Fermanagh , The Cavan Royal School in County Cavan , and The Royal and Prior School in Raphoe , County Donegal . 

The original intention had been to have a " Royal School " in each of Ireland 's counties ( James I Order in Council read , " that there shall be one Free School at least appointed in every County , for the education of youth in learning and religion . " 

) but only five were actually established , the schools planned for other counties never coming into being .
