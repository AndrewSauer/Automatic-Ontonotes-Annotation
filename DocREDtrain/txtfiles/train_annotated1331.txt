The heavily glaciated Weißkamm is an Alpine chain that includes the Weißkugel ( ) and Wildspitze ( ) , the two highest peaks in the Ötztal Alps . 

Starting from the Weißkugel the Weißkamm runs for about 20 kilometres to the northwest towards Sölden . 

Other ridges branch off the Weißkamm striking northwards . 

From west to east these are the Glockturmkamm , the Kaunergrat and the Geigenkamm . 

The Weißkugel is where the Weißkamm joins the Schnalskamm , which runs in an easterly direction . 

The Gepatschferner and the Mittelbergferner are the two largest glaciers in the Ötztal Alps ; both are situated in the area of the Weißkamm . 

Together with the Kesselwandferner , Vernagtferner and Taschachferner they form an almost unbroken ice sheet . 

Apart from the Weißkugel and the Wildspitze , other important summits on the Weißkamm are the Fluchtkogel ( ) , the Hochvernagtspitze ( ) , the Hinterer Brunnenkogel ( ) and the Hinterer Brochkogel ( )
