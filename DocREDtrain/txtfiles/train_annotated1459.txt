The New Chinese Empire is a book by Ross Terrill which was published by Basic Books in 2003 and won the Los Angeles Times Book Prize , Current Interest , for that year . 

The book goes into in - depth explanations about the new and powerful Chinese " empire " and how it affects American society and ideology . 

It also delves deeply into the psyche of the Chinese government 's internal workings and explains China 's view on domestic and foreign policies . 

Terrill 's argument connects an ancient dynastic China with the China of today and their blend of idealism and realism , attachment to doctrine , paternalism , and the obsession with national unity . 

Terrill , a Harvard PhD in Political Science , draws on his professional training and years of visiting China to show in the words of Lucian Pye , " a civilization masquerading as a nation " . 

He depicts China 's longer - term future , not as having a clash of civilizations , but instead of the universals of human nature and social change . 

Terrill is also the writer of the biography , Mao which was first banned in the PRC for its " realistic " portrayal of Mao Zedong , then published by the People 's University Press to become a best seller .
