A chādor ( ) , also variously spelled in English as chadah , chad(d)ar , chader , chud(d)ah , chadur and naturalized as is an outer garment or open cloak worn by some women in Iran , Iraq and some other countries under the Persianate cultural sphere as well as predominantly Shia areas i.e. 

Afghanistan , Azerbaijan , Bahrain , Pakistan , India , Kuwait , Lebanon , Syria , Tajikistan and Turkey , in public spaces or outdoors . 

A chador is a full - body - length semicircle of fabric that is open down the front . 

This cloth is tossed over the woman 's or girl 's head , but then she holds it closed in the front . 

The chador has no hand openings , or any buttons , clasps , etc . , but rather it is held closed by her hands or tucked under the wearer 's arms . 

Before the 1978–79 Iranian Revolution , black chadors were reserved for funerals and periods of mourning . 

Light , printed fabrics were the norm for everyday wear . 

Currently , the majority of Iranian women who wear the chador use the black version outside and reserve light - coloured chadors for indoor use .
