" The Ripper " is a single by British heavy metal band Judas Priest , first released in March 1976 . 

It was also featured on their 1976 studio album Sad Wings of Destiny . 

The Ripper is a heavy rocker having a midpart with layered operatic voices . 

Like " Epitaph " it 's one of the band 's most Queen - inspired songs . 

It tells the story of " Jack the Ripper " from the killer 's point of view . 

It has become a fan favorite and is one of the band 's signature songs . 

Glenn Tipton penned the song shortly after joining the band , but producer Rodger Bain rejected including it on their first album Rocka Rolla . 

The original version that Tipton wrote was much longer than the one eventually included on Sad Wings of Destiny at nearly eight minutes as well as played at a slower tempo . 

It can be heard on some early bootlegs from 1975 â€“ 76 .
