Nops is a genus of medium - sized caponiid spider native to South America , Central America , and the Caribbean islands . 

The genus currently counts 27 extant species plus one fossil in Dominican amber , but probably the real number of extant species is greater . 

Nops have a great richness on the Caribbean islands ( 14 species ) . 

Even species of Central America ( 4 ) and South America ( 15 ) are located in high proportion toward the area of the Caribbean Sea . 

Most species of South America are known only from the coast of Colombia and Venezuela , including the islands of Aruba , Cura√ßao , Bonaire and Trinidad . 

The genus is not revised yet , but apparently have a Neotropical distribution .
