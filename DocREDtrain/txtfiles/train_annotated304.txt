Christmas pudding is a type of pudding traditionally served as part of the Christmas dinner in the UK , Ireland and in other countries where it has been brought by British emigrants . 

It has its origins in medieval England , and is sometimes known as plum pudding or just " pud " , though this can also refer to other kinds of boiled pudding involving dried fruit . 

Despite the name " plum pudding , " the pudding contains no actual plums due to the pre - Victorian use of the word " plums " as a term for raisins . 

The pudding is composed of many dried fruits held together by egg and suet , sometimes moistened by treacle or molasses and flavoured with cinnamon , nutmeg , cloves , ginger , and other spices . 

The pudding is usually aged for a month or more , or even a year ; the high alcohol content of the pudding prevents it from spoiling during this time .
