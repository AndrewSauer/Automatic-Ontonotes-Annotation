Francisco de Osona , also Francisco de Osona the Younger , ( c.1465–c.1514 ) was a Spanish Renaissance painter . 

Francisco was born in Valencia . 

There has been some confusion between Francisco and his father Rodrigo de Osona . 

Father and son worked closely together in their workshop in Valencia , therefore works are often attributed to both , although some assumptions are made that Francisco was more open to what was newer styles and forms in Italy . 

However , while the activity of Rodrigo ended with his death in 1518 , Francisco died before him much younger in 1514 . 

The second table of the Epiphany , preserved in London , is signed by " The teacher 's son Rodrigo " , in which , on the contrary , there seems to have more traditional trend seen in the works of the father . 

Francisco has been credited with Christ before Pilate in the Museu de Belles Arts de València , as well as The Adoration of the Magi in the Victoria and Albert Museum . 

The work of two Osona artists , along with Paolo de San Leocadio , form the basis for Spanish classicism in painting .
