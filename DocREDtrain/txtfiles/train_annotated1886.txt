Qumran (; ) is an archaeological site in the West Bank managed by Israel 's Qumran National Park . 

It is located on a dry plateau about from the northwestern shore of the Dead Sea , near the Israeli settlement and kibbutz of Kalya . 

The Hellenistic period settlement was constructed during the reign of John Hyrcanus ( ) or somewhat later , and was occupied most of the time until it was destroyed by the Romans in or shortly after . 

It is best known as the settlement nearest to the Qumran Caves where the Dead Sea Scrolls were hidden , caves in the sheer desert cliffs and beneath , in the marl terrace . 

The principal excavations at Qumran were conducted by Roland de Vaux in the 1950s , though several later unearthings at the site have since been carried out .
