GEC Plessey Telecommunications ( GPT ) was founded in 1988 as a joint venture between GEC and the British electronics , defence and telecommunications company Plessey . 

A joint holding company of GEC and the German conglomerate Siemens AG acquired Plessey a year later , and GPT was converted into a 60/40 GEC / Siemens joint venture . 

During the mid-1990s , the name GPT gradually disappeared in the UK . 

By October 1997 , the company evolved into Siemens GEC Communication Systems ( SCGS ) . 

In 1998 , it was amalgamated into Siemens Communications ( the largest division of Siemens , which would became part of Siemens Enterprise Communications in 2008 ) . 

In August 1998 , GEC acquired the 40 % stake held by Siemens in GPT ( by now only existing as a legal entity ) , and merged it into its newly founded subsidiary Marconi Communications . 

Through a series of mergers , divisions and restructuring in 1998/1999 , GEC was renamed to Marconi plc , which was again restructured to Marconi Corporation plc in May 2003 . 

In 2005 , Marconi Corporation plc along with its subsidiary Marconi Communications , was sold to Ericsson and the remainder was renamed Telent plc .
