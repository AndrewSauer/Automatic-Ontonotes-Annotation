The Rambler Classic is an intermediate sized automobile that was built and sold by American Motors Corporation ( AMC ) from the 1961 to 1966 model years . 

The Classic took the place of the Rambler Six and Rambler Rebel V-8 names , which were retired at the end of the 1960 model year . 

Introduced at first as only a six - passenger four - door sedan and station wagon versions , additional body styles were added with two - door models available as a " post " sedan and in 1964 as a sporty pillar - less hardtop , as well as a convertible for 1965 and 1966 . 

Motor Trend magazine selected AMC 's Classic line as Car of the Year award for 1963 . 

The Rambler Rebel name replaced Classic on AMC 's completely redesigned large - line of cars in 1967 , and for 1968 the Rebel was renamed the AMC Rebel as AMC began the process of phasing out the Rambler marque . 

Throughout its life in the AMC model line - up , the Classic was the high - volume seller for the independent automaker .
