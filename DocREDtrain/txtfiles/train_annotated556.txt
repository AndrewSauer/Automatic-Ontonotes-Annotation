Bretton Woods is located along U.S. Route 302 , east of the village of Twin Mountain and through scenic Crawford Notch northwest of the town of Bartlett . 

In 1772 King George III granted Sir Thomas Wentworth of Bretton Hall , a country house in West Bretton , West Yorkshire , and 82 others , a parcel of of land to be laid out as a plantation in the White Mountains .
