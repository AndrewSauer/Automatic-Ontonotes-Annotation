The Oruanui eruption of New Zealand 's Taupo Volcano , the world 's most recent supereruption , had a Volcanic Explosivity Index of 8 . 

It is one of the largest eruptions in the history of New Zealand . 

It occurred about 26,500 years ago in the Late Pleistocene and generated approximately of pyroclastic fall deposits , of pyroclastic density current ( PDC ) deposits ( mostly ignimbrite ) and of primary intracaldera material , equivalent to of magma , totaling of total deposits . 

The eruption is divided into 10 different phases on the basis of nine mappable fall units and a tenth , poorly preserved but volumetrically dominant fall unit . 

Modern - day Lake Taupo ( and 186 m deep ) partly fills the caldera generated during this eruption . 

A structural collapse is concealed beneath Lake Taupo , while the lake outline at least partly reflects volcano - tectonic collapse . 

Early eruption phases saw shifting vent positions ; development of the caldera to its maximum extent ( indicated by lithic lag breccias ) occurred during phase 10 . 

The Oruanui eruption shows many unusual features : its episodic nature , wide range of depositional conditions in fall deposits of very wide dispersal , and complex interplay of falls and pyroclastic flows . 

Tephra from the eruption covered much of the central North Island , with ignimbrite up to deep . 

Ashfall affected most of New Zealand , with even an ash layer deposited on the Chatham Islands , away . 

Later erosion and sedimentation had long - lasting effects on the landscape , and caused the Waikato River to shift from the Hauraki Plains to its current course through the Waikato to the Tasman Sea .
