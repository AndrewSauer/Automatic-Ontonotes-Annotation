" Never Alone " is a song written by Gary Burr , Sarah Buxton , and Victoria Shaw and recorded by American songwriter and pianist Jim Brickman . 

Originally recorded with American country music singer Sara Evans on vocals for his 2006 album , Escape , it was famously re - recorded with American country pop trio Lady Antebellum for its release as a single . 

This latter version was released to digital retailers through Savoy Records on February 20 , 2007 and impacted American adult contemporary radio that spring . 

Lady Antebellum 's female vocalist , Hillary Scott , is sometimes credited individually as a featured artist alongside Lady Antebellum . 

" Never Alone " is primarily a new - age song with additional influences of country and pop genres and is instrumented primarily by piano . 

Its lyrics discuss the idea of unconditional love and support as well as the importance of holding onto one 's faith through difficult times . 

The song was released to generally positive reviews , who complimented its country crossover appeal , and was a success on adult contemporary radio . 

It peaked at number 14 on the Billboard Adult Contemporary airplay chart in July 2007 , earning Brickman his 22nd entry on the chart and 13th top-15 hit . 

Furthermore , the song was Lady Antebellum 's first entry on a Billboard chart before their proper debut single , " Love Do n't Live Here " , was released in October of that year ; they would later match this position with their own single , " I Run to You " in 2009 before topping the AC chart with " Need You Now " that same year .
