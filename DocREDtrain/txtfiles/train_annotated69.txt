A member of the United States Senate can resign by writing a letter of resignation to the governor of the state that the senator represents . 

Under Article I , Section 3 of the Constitution of the United States , and under the Seventeenth Amendment , in case of a vacancy in the Senate resulting from resignation , the executive authority of the state ( today known in every state as the governor ) can fill the vacancy by appointment unless the state legislature has provided for a special election to fill the vacancy . 

Whenever a senator needs to be appointed or elected , the Secretary of the Senate mails one of three forms to the state 's governor to inform them of the proper wording to certify the appointment of a new Senator . 

The first resignation from the Senate was that of William Paterson of New Jersey on November 13 , 1790 , who resigned in order to accept the office of Governor of New Jersey . 

His resignation was only the third time a person ceased to hold a seat in the Senate , which had first convened during the preceding year , 1789 . 

The earlier ones resulted from the death of Senator William Grayson of Virginia , and the expiration of the term of the temporary senator John Walker of Virginia , who was appointed by the Governor of Virginia to hold that office until a successor could be elected in November . 

Before 1796 , eight senators resigned . 

Nine senators resigned during that year â€“ a record high number that stands to this day . 

Most resignations have been motivated either by declining health or a decision to accept another office . 

Sixteen persons have resigned from the Senate twice and two have resigned three times .
