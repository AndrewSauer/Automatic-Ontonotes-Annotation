Friedrich ( died 13 April 1135 ) , Count of Stade . 

Friedrich ’s mother was from England and died in a shipwreck off the coast of Germany . 

She was fleeing England after the conquest of the island by William the Conqueror . 

Upon the death of Lothair Udo III in 1106 , the title of Margrave of the Nordmark went to his brother Rudolf I. 

The title Count of Stade also went to Rudolf in all likelihood , but Friedrich was appointed to administer the county as Viscount of Stade until Lothar ’s son Henry could assume the role . 

Friedrich aligned with Lothar of Süpplingenburg , then Duke of Saxony , against Emperor Henry V. He was imprisoned with Lothar , and eventually released by the emperor . 

After the Battle of Welfesholz , with no further help expected from the emperor , Lothar proved a good ally , and his role as count assured . 

When Henry II came of age , he became Count of Stade . 

Upon his death in 1128 , Friedrich was officially invested by Archbishop Adalbero of Bremen with the County of Stade . 

After the death of Frederick in 1135 , the County of Stade reverted to the House of Udonids , and the countship was assumed by Udo V. Frederick was buried in Harsefeld monastery next to the other counts of Stade .
