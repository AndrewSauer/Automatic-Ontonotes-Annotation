Babik Reinhardt ( 8 June 1944 – 13 November 2001 ) was a guitarist and the younger son of gypsy jazz guitarist Django Reinhardt by Django 's second wife , Naguine . 

His elder half brother Lousson , who was Django 's son by his first wife , Bella , was also a guitarist , but the two grew up in different families and rarely met . 

Reinhardt was born in Paris . 

He learned guitar not from his father but from his mother ; his father gave him piano lessons . 

When Reinhardt was nine years old , his father died . 

His musical education in guitar was continued by uncles and cousins . 

Drawn more to jazz fusion than gypsy jazz , Reinhardt recorded with fusion pioneer Larry Coryell and French violinist Didier Lockwood in the 1990s . 

In 2001 , he died of a heart attack at the age of 57 in Cannes , France . 

Reinhardt appeared on the album Generation Django ( Dreyfus , 2009 ) , a tribute to his father recorded by multiple musicians , including Django 's grandson , David , and Biréli Lagrène .
