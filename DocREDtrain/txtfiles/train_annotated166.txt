Mount Cardigan is a prominent bare - rock summit in the towns of Orange and Alexandria in western New Hampshire , USA . 

While its peak is only above sea level , it has extensive areas of bare granite ledges and alpine scrub , giving it the feel to hikers of a much higher mountain . 

Most of the summit area was denuded by devastating forest fires in 1855 . 

The Civilian Conservation Corps helped to develop the alpine ski trail network still in use today on the east side of the mountain . 

The mountain is set in the Cardigan Mountain State Park . 

The Cardigan Lodge , operated by the Appalachian Mountain Club since 1934 , is located to the east at the foot of the mountain , and is often used as a base for day hikes in and around the mountain . 

Many schools from around New England have overnight field trips to the mountain during the autumn and spring months .. 

The mountain is also a popular destination for Boy Scout troops .
