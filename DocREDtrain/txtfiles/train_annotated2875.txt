Marriage in Scotland is recognised in the form of both civil and religious unions between individuals . 

Historically , the law of marriage has developed differently in Scotland to other jurisdictions in the United Kingdom as a consequence of the differences in Scots law and role of the separate established Church of Scotland . 

These differences led to a tradition of couples from England and Wales eloping to Scotland , most famously to marry at border towns such as Gretna Green . 

The legal minimum age to enter into a marriage in Scotland is sixteen years and does not require parental consent at any age . 

In Scots law , there is a distinction between so called religious marriages , conducted by an authorised celebrant , and civil marriages , conducted by a state registrar , but anyone over the age of 21 can apply to the Registrar General for authorisation to conduct a marriage under s12 of the Marriage ( Scotland ) Act 1977 , and no form of religious ceremony is necessary . 

Since a decision of the Registrar - General in 2005 , statutory references to religious marriages must be " read in " as referring to " religion or belief " , in order to ensure compatibility with the Human Rights Act 1998 and allow humanists to conduct legal humanist marriages , which like civil marriages are also non - religious . 

As of 2017 , the Humanist Society Scotland conducted more marriages each year than the largest religious body , the Church of Scotland . 

Civil partnerships became available to same - sex couples in the United Kingdom in 2005 and grant rights and responsibilities virtually identical to civil marriage . 

In September 2011 , the Scottish Government launched a public consultation on the introduction of same - sex marriage , with the Scottish Government indicating it " tend[ed ] towards the view that same - sex marriage should be introduced " . 

On 4 February 2014 , the Scottish Parliament passed a same - sex marriage bill by a vote of 105 to 18 .
