Gordon , or " Whipped Peter " ( fl . 

1863 ) , was an enslaved African American who escaped from a Louisiana plantation in March 1863 , gaining freedom when he reached the Union camp near Baton Rouge . 

He became known as the subject of photographs documenting the extensive scarring of his back from whippings received in slavery . 

Abolitionists distributed these carte de visite photographs of Gordon throughout the United States and internationally to show the abuses of slavery . 

In July 1863 these images appeared in an article about Gordon published in Harper 's Weekly , the most widely read journal during the Civil War . 

The pictures of Gordon 's scourged back provided Northerners with visual evidence of brutal treatment of slaves and inspired many free blacks to enlist in the Union Army . 

Gordon joined the United States Colored Troops soon after their founding , and served as a soldier in the war .
