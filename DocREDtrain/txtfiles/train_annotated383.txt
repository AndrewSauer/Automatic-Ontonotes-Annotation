, son of Duke Nobusuke , was a Japanese researcher of trains . 

He was a descendant of Tokugawa Yoshinao and consequently was born into an aristocratic family , but , like all Japanese aristocrats , lost his title with the post - war legal reforms of 1947 . 

He worked at TEI Park , a railroad museum in Tokyo . 

He married the third daughter of Emperor Hirohito , Princess Kazuko ; they adopted a son from OgyÅ« - Matsudaira , Naotake . 

On 28 January 1966 , Toshimichi Takatsukasa was found dead of carbon monoxide poisoning at the apartment of his mistress , Michiko Maeda , a Ginza nightclub hostess , who also died of the same cause . 

While the official cause of death was attributed to a faulty heater , there was widespread speculation in the Japanese press that it was really a double suicide , caused by his inability to divorce and marry the woman he loved .
