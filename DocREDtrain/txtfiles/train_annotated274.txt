The Connecticut River Walk is partially constructed park and bikeway in Springfield , Massachusetts , United States , along the banks of New England 's largest river , the Connecticut River . 

Currently , Springfield 's section of this park is 3.7 miles long , running from Chicopee , Massachusetts to the South End Bridge in Springfield , Massachusetts . 

Unique features of the trail include its path alongside an active - and soon - to - be the United States ' first high - speed - train line , making it a " rail - with - trail , " and its passing in very close proximity to the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame . 

The longest river in New England , the Connecticut River is the Knowledge Corridor 's most prominent natural asset . 

For centuries it has been a source of regional identity and pride ; however , currently most residents are cut off from it by Interstate 91 - a 1960s - era elevated highway , which has become a major inhibitor to Springfield 's economic and recreational riverfront growth , especially in recent years .
