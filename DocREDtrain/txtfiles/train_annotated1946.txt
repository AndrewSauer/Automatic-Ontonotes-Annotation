The Treaty of Gyalu was an agreement between Holy Roman Emperor Ferdinand I and Isabella Jagiellon the queen dowager of the Eastern Hungarian Kingdom and the widow of John Zápolya , signed in Gyalu ( today Gilău , Romania ) by Gáspár Serédy captain of Upper Hungary and János Statileo bishop of Transylvania on December 29 , 1541 . 

The participants tried to renegotiate John Sigismund Zápolya 's possessions in connection with the previous Treaty of Nagyvárad . 

According to the treaty , Royal Hungary and the Eastern Hungarian Kingdom would have been re - united under Ferdinand 's rule , in case he had recaptured Buda . 

However , the Diet of Torda negotiated the Ottoman disapproval in reference to the treaty in October and refused to accept the terms of the agreement on December 20 , 1542 . 

The eastern territories of the former medieval Kingdom of Hungary ruled by King John Sigismund Zápolya were known as the Eastern Hungarian Kingdom until the Treaty of Speyer ( 1570 ) .
