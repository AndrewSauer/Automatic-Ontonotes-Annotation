Ashley Mote ( born 25 January 1936 ) is a former Member of the European Parliament ( MEP ) for South East England from 2004 to 2009 . 

Elected representing the UK Independence Party , he became a non - inscrit one month into his term after UKIP withdrew the whip from him due to investigation into his expenses . 

A vociferous critic of fraud in the European Institutions , he himself was convicted of benefit fraud in 2007 for which he served a nine - month prison sentence and was described by the trial judge as " a truly dishonest man " . 

The scandal ignited a debate as to how an MEP could receive a prison sentence , yet keep his seat in the European Parliament ; there are moves afoot to review the legislation . 

In 2015 , Mote was jailed for a further five years for fraudulently claiming nearly Â£ 500,000 in European Parliament expenses .
