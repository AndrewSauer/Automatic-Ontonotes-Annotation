Environmental subsystems are central components of operating systems of the Windows NT type . 

They allow the operating system to run software developed for the platform in question . 

For example , Windows NT 4.0 has four environmental subsystems , viz Win32 , DOS or Win16 , OS/2 , and POSIX , the latter of which is a Unix standard . 

The latter resides primarily in the Dynamic Link Library posix.dll . 

The environmental subsystems are one part of the strategy Microsoft developed for making the Windows NT stream of operating systems a hub for multi - platform computing Others include four Hardware Abstraction layers , one for Intel processors , three for RISC processors ( DEC Alpha , PowerPC , Mips ) , and a driver for the HPFS , the standard for OS/2 . 

Since Windows 2000 , the FAT32 file system first introduced with Windows 95 has also been present , with HPFS deprecated then being omitted in later systems . 

A third - party driver for FAT32 can be used on the earlier NT operating systems . 

Therefore , Windows NT as of version 4.0 had a default of four file systems ( NTFS , HPFS , FAT12 , and FAT16 ) , and installations of the system with a driver allowing access to a fifth FAT32 ) are very common , and tools allowing access to Unix file systems are also in existence . 

Interoperability with Novell Netware is generally implemented at the applications and systems programming level rather than at the kernel and data link layer and therefore further from the physical hardware .
