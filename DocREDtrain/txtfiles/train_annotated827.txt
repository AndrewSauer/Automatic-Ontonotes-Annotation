Palazzo Uguccioni is a Renaissance palace on the Piazza della Signoria in Florence , central Italy . 

The palace was built , for Giovanni Uguccioni starting from 1550 . 

Its design has been variously attributed to Raphael , Michelangelo , Andrea Palladio , Bartolomeo Ammannati or Raffaello da Montelupo , although no proofs exists if not that its drawing came from Rome in 1549 and that its style was reminiscent of Raphael 's or Bramante 's , which were a novelty in Florence at the time . 

It is the only building in Florence with columns on its façade . 

The lower floors has three arcades with rustication in pietraforte , the material used for the whole façade . 

The upper floors have two orders of Ionic ( first floor ) and Corithian ( second floor ) columns . 

The latter 's pedestals have sculpted coat of arms of the family . 

Above the entrance is a bust of Francesco I de ' Medici , perhaps executed by Giambologna .
