The Galápagos Islands are an isolated set of volcanoes , consisting of shield volcanoes and lava plateaus , located west of Ecuador . 

They are driven by the Galápagos hotspot , and are between 4.2 million and 700,000 years of age . 

The largest island , Isabela , consists of six coalesced shield volcanoes , each delineated by a large summit caldera . 

Española , the oldest island , and Fernandina , the youngest , are also shield volcanoes , as are most of the other islands in the chain . 

The Galápagos Islands are perched on a large lava plateau known as the Galápagos Platform , which creates a shallow - water depth of at the base of the islands , which stretch over a -long diameter . 

Since Charles Darwin 's famous visit to the islands in 1835 , over 60 recorded eruptions have occurred in the islands , from six different shield volcanoes . 

Of the 21 emergent volcanoes , 13 are considered active . 

The Galápagos are geologically young for such a big chain , and the pattern of their rift zones follows one of two trends , one north - northwest , and one east - west . 

The composition of the lavas of the Galápagos shields are strikingly similar to those of the Hawaiian volcanoes . 

Curiously , they do not form the same volcanic " line " associated with most hotspots . 

They are not alone in this regard ; the Cobb – Eickelberg Seamount chain in the North Pacific is another example of such a delineated chain . 

In addition , no clear pattern of age is seen between the volcanoes , suggesting a complicated , irregular pattern of creation . 

How exactly the islands were formed remains a geological mystery , although several theories have been posited .
