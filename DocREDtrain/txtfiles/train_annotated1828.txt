Sister Kenny is a 1946 American biographical film about Sister Elizabeth Kenny , an Australian bush nurse , who fought to help people who suffered from polio , despite opposition from the medical establishment . 

The film stars Rosalind Russell , Alexander Knox , and Philip Merivale . 

The film was adapted by Alexander Knox , Mary McCarthy , Milton Gunzburg ( uncredited ) , and Dudley Nichols from the book And They Shall Walk , by Elizabeth Kenny and Martha Ostenso , and directed by Dudley Nichols . 

The " Sister " in the title does not refer to being a religious sister , but rather a rank she had held as a nurse in the Australian Army . 

It is also a term for a senior RN ( which Kenny was not ) .
