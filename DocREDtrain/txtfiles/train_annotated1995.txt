The Capital City Trail is a shared use path for cyclists and pedestrians , which circles the Melbourne city centre and some inner eastern and northern suburbs of Melbourne , Victoria , Australia . 

It is 29 km in length , and mostly consists of sections of other trails , such as the Merri Creek Trail , Main Yarra Trail , Moonee Ponds Creek Trail and Inner Circle Rail Trail . 

A popular starting point for the trail is at Princes Bridge near Flinders Street Station . 

The rider can head off in an easterly or westerly direction . 

If heading off in the westerly , either side of the river can be used , but the south side tends to be more popular . 

The Capital City Trail uses the same path as the Main Yarra Trail up to Dights Falls , where it continues , using the same path as the Merri Creek Trail , as part of its loop around the city .
