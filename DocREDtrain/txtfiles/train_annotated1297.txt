" To Be or Not to Be " ( also known as " The Hitler Rap " ) is a song recorded by Mel Brooks in 1983 for Island Records . 

The song appeared on the soundtrack album for the movie with the same name . 

It was derived from the burlesque show within the film but did not appear within it . 

It also echoes Brooks ' 1967 film The Producers , with the lines " Do n't be stupid , be a smarty . 

Come and join the Nazi Party " taken from the song " Springtime for Hitler " . 

In the accompanying music video , Mel Brooks is dressed like Adolf Hitler and raps about the key events in Hitler 's life in Third Reich . 

While having limited success in the United States , the song managed to chart high in Australia and the United Kingdom , peaking at number three in the former country and number 12 on the UK Singles Chart . 

It also reached number one in Norway and number two in Sweden .
