Maham Begam or Mahim Begum ( died 28 March 1534 ; ; meaning " My moon " ) was Empress of Mughal Empire from 20 April 1526 to 26 December 1530 as the third wife and chief consort of Babur , the founder of the Mughal Empire and the first Mughal emperor . 

Maham Begum is rightly counted as one of the initial Queens among the Mughals who could be placed on the pinnacle in view of her substantial role and attractive personality . 

Babur conferred her the superlative imperial title Padshah Begum . 

The title was first time used for her which was given to the first lady of the Court of Empire . 

Maham Begum is frequently mentioned in the Humayun Nama by her adoptive daughter Gulbadan Begum , who calls her ' lady and my Lady ' ( aka and akam ) .
