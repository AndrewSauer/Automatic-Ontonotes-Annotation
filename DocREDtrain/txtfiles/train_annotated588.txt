" Mexico " is a single released in May 1970 by San Francisco rock band Jefferson Airplane , produced by the band at Pacific High Recording Studios with Phill Sawyer as the recording engineer . 

Written and sung by Grace Slick , it is a tuneful rant against then - President Richard Nixon and his anti - drug initiative , Operation Intercept , that he had implemented to curtail the flow of marijuana into the United States from Mexico . 

The song closes with an exhortation for the young to realize the power of their numbers , as shown by the gathering of " half a million people on the lawn " at Woodstock . 

The song received little radio airplay , being banned in some states , but did reach # 102 on the Billboard charts . 

The version on the 2400 Fulton Street LP and CD is a completely different mix from that on the single . 

Five months after the release of " Mexico " , President Nixon requested that songs relating to drug abuse not be broadcast . 

Live versions of " Mexico " and its B - side , " Have You Seen the Saucers " , were intended to be released on the next Airplane album ; however , Marty Balin left the band before production of Bark was completed , forcing a change in some of the planned material . 

A live version of " Have You Seen the Saucers " appeared as the opening track of the live album Thirty Seconds Over Winterland ; the two studio tracks were finally released on an album when the Early Flight compilation was released .
