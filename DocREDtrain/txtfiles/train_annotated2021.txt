Joseph Charlier ( 20 June 1816 – 6 December 1896 ) was a Belgian self - described jurist , writer , accountant , and merchant . 

He was one of the earliest proponents of a citizen 's income or guaranteed minimum income , preceding even the " state bonus " scheme published by British Dennis Milner ( 1892–1956 ) in 1920 . 

Charlier was influenced by Charles Fourier . 

According to John Stuart Mill , Fourierism required that " in the distribution , a certain minimum is first assigned for the subsistence of every member of the community , whether capable or not of labour . " 

Fourier and his foremost disciple Victor Prosper Considérant criticized civilization for failing to provide a minimum to the poor , but feared widespread idleness and a collapsing civilization if workers previously depending on " repugnant " labor for income had a choice . 

Considérant , in some of his writings , suggested that society guarantee a right to work in order to compensate them for denying equal access to natural resources . 

( " La condition sine quâ non - pour la Légitimité de la Propriété est donc que la Société reconnaisse au Prolétaire le droit au travail et qu’elle lui assure au moins autant de moyens de subsistance , pour un exercice d’activité donné , que cet exercice eût pu lui en procurer dans l’État primitif . " ) 

Charlier agreed with Fourierism that the central problem was the improvement of the condition of the disinherited classes ( " amélioration du sort des classes déshéritées " ) . 

He rejected " the right to assistance " , a solution addressing effects rather than the cause , and the " right to work / organization of labor " which he expected to result in an extension of state control . 

Instead , Charlier proposed a scheme with a basic income paid unconditionally to every member of society , regardless of need or ability to work . 

In 1896 at age 80 , Charlier died at Brussels where he was born .
