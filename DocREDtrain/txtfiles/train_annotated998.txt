The Tikchik River is a stream , long , in the U.S. state of Alaska . 

Beginning at Nishlik Lake in the Kuskokwim Mountains , it flows southeast into Tikchik Lake , north of Dillingham . 

Tikchik Lake empties into the Nuyakuk River , a tributary of the Nushagak River , which flows to Nushagak Bay , an arm of Bristol Bay . 

Water from Upnuk Lake flows about to join the river downstream of Nishlik Lake . 

Both lakes and the river lie within Wood - Tikchik State Park , at the largest state park in the United States . 

Alaska Fishing says the river " makes an exciting float ... with some potentially good fishing ... " . 

Boating dangers include overhanging vegetation and bears , which feed on salmon . 

The main game fish frequenting the Tikchik are Arctic grayling , char , and red salmon , as well as lake trout in the lakes .
