François - Nicolas Delaistre ( Paris 9 March 1746 – 23 April 1832 Paris ) was a French sculptor . 

Delaistre was educated by Félix Lecomte and Louis - Claude Vassé . 

Delaistre won the Prix de Rome in 1772 ; he studied a year at the École royale des élèves protégés at the French Academy and later at the Académie de France in Rome between 1773 and 1777 . 

It was there that he probably first met the architect Pierre - Adrien Pâris , with whom he later collaborated . 

His best - known work , the group Cupid and Psyche , was originally executed in Rome ( the later marble version is in the Louvre at Paris ) . 

The Nuttall Encyclopedia mentions " Delaistre , a French statuary , born in Paris ( 1836 - 1891 ) " : this may be a relative of François Delaistre .
