The Papagayo jet , also referred to as the Papagayo Wind or the Papagayo Wind Jet , are strong intermittent winds that blow approximately 70   km north of the Gulf of Papagayo , after which they are named . 

The jet winds travel southwest from the Caribbean and the Gulf of Mexico to the Pacific Ocean through a pass in the Cordillera mountains at Lake Nicaragua . 

The jet follows the same path as the northeast trade winds in this region ; however , due to a unique combination of synoptic scale meteorology and orographic phenomena , the jet winds can reach much greater speeds than their trade wind counterparts . 

That is to say , the winds occur when cold high - pressure systems from the North American continent meet warm moist air over the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico , generating winds that are then funneled through a mountain pass in the Cordillera . 

The Papagayo jet is also not unique to this region . 

There are two other breaks in the Cordillera where this same phenomenon occurs , one at the Chivela Pass in México and another at the Panama Canal , producing the Tehuano ( Tehuantepecer ) and the Panama jets respectively . 

The Papagayo jet also induces mesoscale meteorology phenomena that influence the pacific waters hundreds of kilometers off the Nicaraguan and Costa Rican shores . 

When the jet wind surges , it creates cyclonic and anticyclonic eddies , Ekman transport , and upwelling that contribute to the creation of the Costa Rica Dome off the western coast of Central America in the Western Hemisphere Warm Pool ( WHWP ) . 

The relatively cold , nutrient - rich waters of the dome , in comparison to the surrounding WHWP , create an ideal habitat for a number of species making the Papagayo Wind Jet important for biodiversity in the Eastern Tropical Pacific .
