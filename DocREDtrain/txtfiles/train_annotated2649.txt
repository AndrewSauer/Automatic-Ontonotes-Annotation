" The Responsibility of Intellectuals " is an essay by the American academic Noam Chomsky which was published as a special supplement by The New York Review of Books on the 23 February 1967 . 

The article was written during the then - ongoing Vietnam War , as news of human rights abuses started to return to the United States , and as the war had increasingly become seen as a quagmire . 

An attack on the intellectual culture in the U.S. , Chomsky argues that it is largely subservient to power . 

He is particularly critical of social scientists and technocrats , who he believed were providing a pseudo - scientific justification for the crimes of the state in regard to the Vietnam War . 

He notes that those who opposed the war on moral rather than technical grounds are " often psychologists , mathematicians , chemists , or philosophers , ... rather than people with Washington contacts , who , of course , realize that ' had they a new , good idea about Vietnam , they would get a prompt and respectful hearing ' in Washington . " 

The topic was inspired by articles of Dwight Macdonald published after the Second World War who " asks the question : To what extent were the German or Japanese people responsible for the atrocities committed by their governments ? 

And , quite properly , ... turns the question back to us : To what extent are the British or American people responsible for the vicious terror bombings of civilians , perfected as a technique of warfare by the Western democracies and reaching their culmination in Hiroshima and Nagasaki , surely among the most unspeakable crimes in history . " 

The article brought Chomsky to public attention as one of the leading American intellectuals in the movement against the Vietnam war .
