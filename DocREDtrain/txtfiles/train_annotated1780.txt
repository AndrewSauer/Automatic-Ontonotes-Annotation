The scarlet minivet ( Pericrocotus speciosus ) is a small passerine bird . 

This minivet is found in tropical southern Asia from India to southern China , Indonesia , and the Philippines . 

They are common resident breeding birds in forests and other well - wooded habitats including gardens , especially in hilly country . 

While the male of most subspecies are scarlet to orange with black upper parts , the females are usually yellow with greyish olive upper parts . 

Several former subspecies have been elevated to species status in recent works . 

These include the orange minivet . 

All subspecies have the same habits of gleaning for insects and are often seen in mixed - species foraging flocks , usually foraging in small groups , high up in the forest canopy .
