The Maximato was a period in the historical and political development of Mexico from 1928 to 1934 . 

Named after former president Plutarco Elías Calles 's sobriquet el Jefe Máximo ( the maximum leader ) , the Maximato was the period when Calles continued to exercise power , but did not hold the presidential office . 

The six - year period was the term that president - elect Alvaro Obregón would have served had he not been assassinated directly after the July 1928 elections . 

There needed to be some kind of political solution to the presidential succession crisis . 

Calles could not hold the presidency again , due to restrictions on re - election without an interval out of power , but he remained the dominant figure in Mexico . 

There were two solutions to the crisis . 

Firstly , an interim president was to be appointed followed by new elections . 

Secondly , Calles created an enduring political institution , the Partido Nacional Revolucionario ( PNR ) , that held presidential power from 1929 until 2000 . 

The interim presidency of Emilio Portes Gil lasted from 1 December 1928 to 4 February 1930 . 

He was passed over as candidate for the newly formed PNR in favor of a political unknown , Pascual Ortiz Rubio . 

Ortiz Rubio resigned in September 1932 , in protest at Calles 's continued wielding of power . 

He was succeeded by Abelardo L. Rodríguez , who served out the rest of the term that ended in 1934 . 

The election of that year was won by former revolutionary general Lázaro Cárdenas , Calles 's chosen candidate for the PNR . 

Following the election , Calles attempted to control Cárdenas in the same way he had the three " puppet presidents " , but Cárdenas outmaneuvered him politically , and expelled him from the country in 1936 . 

The Maximato was a transitional period of personal power for Calles , but the institutionalization of political power in the party structure was a major achievement in Mexican history .
