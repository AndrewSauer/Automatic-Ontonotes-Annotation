Baxter Creek or Stege Creek ( also archaically Bishop Creek ) , is a three - branch creek in Richmond and El Cerrito , California , United States forming the Baxter Creek watershed . 

The creek has three sources and flows from the Berkeley Hills to Stege Marsh and the San Francisco Bay . 

The Baxter Creek watershed at - large has 10 sources . 

The creek has been largely culverted over the years since the Rancho San Pablo and the subdivided Bishop Ranch , then known as Bishop Creek , were urbanized . 

Residents missed the creek when it disappeared under the asphalt and formed Friends of Baxter Creek . 

This group has aided in the restoration of several portions of the creek . 

Baxter Creek Park , Poinsett Park , and Booker T. Anderson Park are now in a more natural riparian condition , though the Anderson Park portion has been plagued by litter and shopping carts . 

The Ohlone Greenway bicycle and pedestrian path has its northern terminus at Baxter Creek Gateway Park , located just north of where the BART tracks cross over San Pablo Avenue in Richmond . 

The origins of the name Baxter Creek is unknown , but historians believe it to be from a family which once owned land in the area . 

Stege is from Richard Stege and Bishop comes from Thomas Bishop , who once owned large tracts of land in the area . 

Much of the streamside vegetation that had been restored to Booker T. Anderson Park was chainsawed away and leveled due to concerns that the riparian habitat hid muggings , drug dealings , and public sex from police patrols .
