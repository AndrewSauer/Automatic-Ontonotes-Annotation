Girolamo Parabosco ( c. 1524 â€“ April 21 , 1557 ) was an Italian writer , composer , organist , and poet of the Renaissance . 

He was born in Piacenza , the son of a famous organist , Vincenzo Parabosco . 

Little is known of his childhood , but he went to Venice early for his musical education and is mentioned as a student of Adrian Willaert , the founder of the Venetian School , near the end of 1541 . 

In 1546 he visited Florence as a guest of Francesco Corteccia , musician to the Medici and the leading musician of that city . 

After a period of travels , during which he visited other cities in northern Italy , he returned to Venice and became first organist at St. Mark 's , which was at that time becoming one of the most distinguished musical institutions in Italy . 

He remained employed by St. Mark 's for the rest of his life , and died in Venice in 1557 . 

He wrote Rime and prose comedies , but he is best known by I Diporti , a collection of stories after the model of Boccaccio 's Decameron supposed to be told by a fowling - party weatherbound on an island in the Venetian lagoons . 

Of his compositions , a book of madrigals for five voices , published in Venice in 1546 , remains , as well as four other madrigals published in 1541 and 1544 , and some instrumental music . 

The style of the madrigals is similar to that of Willaert , but even more densely polyphonic than that of his teacher ; they are more akin to motets than to most of the madrigals being written in Italy in the early 1540s . 

One of his instrumental works is a ricercar based on " Da Pacem " , the antiphon for peace ; it may have been written for the end of the war in 1540 between Venice and the Ottoman Turks .
