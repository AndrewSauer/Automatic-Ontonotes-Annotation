The " Trump travel ban(s ) " ( sometimes called the " Trump Muslim ban(s ) " ) is the colloquial name for executive actions taken by Donald Trump as President of the United States in 2017 . 

The actions include two executive orders for restrictions on citizens of seven ( first executive order ) or six ( second executive order ) Muslim - majority countries . 

A third action , done by a presidential proclamation , restricts entry to the U.S. by citizens of eight countries ; six of these countries are predominantly Muslim . 

Below is a list of the three actions . 

Executive Order 13769 ( January 27 , 2017 ) – The original travel ban . 

Executive Order 13780 ( March 6 , 2017 ) – The second and revised travel ban superseding the original travel ban . 

This ban was set to expire after 90 days . 

Presidential Proclamation 9645 ( September 24 , 2017 ) – A third travel ban to replace the second one , which expired after 90 days . 

In the days after the first executive order was issued , White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer objected to the characterization of the executive order as a " travel ban " . 

However , Trump himself referred to his actions as a " travel ban " . 

In early May 2017 , Spicer was asked by a reporter " If this White House is no longer calling this a ' Muslim ban' ... why does the president 's website still explicitly call for ‘ preventing Muslim immigration ? ' " 

After the question was asked , the text " DONALD J. TRUMP STATEMENT ON PREVENTING MUSLIM IMMIGRATION " was noted to have been removed from Trump 's campaign website . 

All three travel bans have been challenged in court .
