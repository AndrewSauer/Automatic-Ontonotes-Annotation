Semir Ben - Amor ( born May 5 , 1982 ) is a Finnish retired professional ice hockey player who last played for Ässät of the SM - liiga . 

Ben - Amor was born and raised in Espoo Tapiola . 

Ben - Amor was a key player in the 2012 notorious practice game between HIFK and Jokerit , where multiple long suspensions were given for violent and unsportsmanlike behavior to players as well as coaches from both teams . 

Ben - Amor was given the longest suspension of 18 games for checking Ville Peltonen from a blind spot in the middle of the ice , and then beating him while he was down and rendering him unconscious . 

Reportedly , someone from Jokerit 's command told Ben - Amor to take him down , and the league gave the head and assisting coach both a suspension of eight games with clear signs of encouraging players to break the rules . 

Ben - Amor denies this , saying it was his own decision , but he regrets how it ultimately happened . 

In December 2012 , he was fined € 3,540 for assault . 

His 18 game suspension remains the third longest in the league 's history , behind Ari Lähteenmäki 's 27 game suspension in 1986 for cross - checking and violence , and Jere Karalahti 's 22 game suspension in 1997 for the use of drugs .
