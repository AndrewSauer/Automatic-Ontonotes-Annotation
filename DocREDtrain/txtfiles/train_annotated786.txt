Dixon of Dock Green was a BBC television series about daily life at a London police station , with the emphasis on petty crime , successfully controlled through common sense and human understanding . 

The central character was a mature and sympathetic police constable , George Dixon , played by Jack Warner in all of the 432 episodes , from 1955 to 1976 . 

Dixon was the embodiment of a typical " bobby " who would be familiar with the area and its residents in which he patrolled and often lived there himself . 

The series contrasted with later programmes such as Z - Cars , which reflected a more aggressive policing culture . 

It retained a faithful following throughout its run and was voted second most popular programme on British TV in 1961 .
