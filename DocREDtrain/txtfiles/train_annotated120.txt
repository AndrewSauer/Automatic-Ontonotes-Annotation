Zigong dialect ( ) is a branch of Southwestern Mandarin , spoken mainly in Zigong , Fushun , Weiyuan , east Rongxian and some parts of Yibin , Neijiang , Longchang and other neighboring areas of Sichuan . 

At least four Chinese dialects are spoken in Zigong City : Zigong dialect , Rongxian dialect , Hakka and Minjiang dialect . 

A majority of people in Zigong speak Zigong dialect . 

However , most people in Rongxian , a county of Zigong City , speak Rongxian dialect , whose pronunciation is quite different from that of Zigong dialect . 

Besides , owing to a great number of Hakka immigrants in history , a small number of Hakka people in certain towns also remain to speak Hakka . 

Also , Minjiang dialect is spoken in a few remote towns or villages bordering to Luzhou , Leshan and Yibin .
