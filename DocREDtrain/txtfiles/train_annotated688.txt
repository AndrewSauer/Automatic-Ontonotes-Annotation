Frederick Newton ( 1951 – 8 August 1986 ) was the head of the Dominica Defence Force ( DDF ) from its independence in 1978 until 1981 . 

He was executed in 1986 for organising an attempted coup d'état in 1981 that resulted in the death of a police officer . 

Newton was trained by the Guyana Defence Force . 

In January 1983 , Newton and five of his soldiers received death sentences by a Dominica court for organising and participating in the failed 1981 coup that was aimed at overthrowing Prime Minister Eugenia Charles . 

( The coup attempt was unrelated to Operation Red Dog , which was organised by former prime minister Patrick John . ) 

The five soldiers ' sentences were eventually commuted to life imprisonment , but in 1986 , Newton became the first person to be executed by Dominica since its independence from the United Kingdom when he was hanged in Roseau . 

He is the only person to have been executed by Dominica as an independent state .
