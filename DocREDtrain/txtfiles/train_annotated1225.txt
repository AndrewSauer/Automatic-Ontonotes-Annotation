Laufás - Edda ( Edda Magnúsar Ólafssonar ) is a famous 17th century redaction of the Snorra Edda , which survives in numerous Icelandic manuscripts . 

Laufás Edda was compiled by the Icelandic priest and poet Magnús Ólafsson ( c.1573 – 1636 ) on the request of the Icelandic scholar and antiquarian Arngrímur Jónsson . 

Magnús began his work at Auðkúla in 1607 after he had been dismissed from his office as parish minister , and completed his new redaction during the winter of 1608 - 09 . 

Magnús would later serve as the priest at Laufás parish in Northern Iceland and as a consequence his version of the Edda was falsely referred to as the Laufás Edda . 

The purpose of his efforts was to make a systematic and encyclopedic version of Snorri Sturluson 's Prose Edda . 

Laufás Edda is a rearranged redaction of the Snorra Edda . 

The myths in Gylfaginning are presented as a series of examples ( apologi or dæmisögur ) and the kennings of Skáldskaparmál are organized alphabetically . 

The last part , Háttatal , was not included . 

Due to its popularity , the Laufás redaction later became the basis for the first printed Edition of the Snorra Edda , Peder Hansen Resen 's Edda Islandorum . 

Resen 's edition was accompanied by a Danish and Latin translation . 

The Laufás Edda , especially through Resen 's edition , became a convenient and popular work of reference for poets and antiquarians , serving as an encyclopedia for researching both myth and poetic language .
