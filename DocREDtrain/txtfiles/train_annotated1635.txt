Censorship in the Polish People 's Republic was primarily performed by the Polish Main Office of Control of Press , Publications and Shows ( Główny Urząd Kontroli Prasy , Publikacji i Widowisk ) , a governmental institution created in 1946 by the pro - Soviet Provisional Government of National Unity with Stalin 's approval and backing , and renamed in 1981 as the Główny Urząd Kontroli Publikacji i Widowisk . 

The bureau was liquidated after the fall of communism in Poland , in April 1990 . 

Library collections were systematically cleansed , the majority of the books destroyed , some isolated in Party or academic libraries . 

A list of prohibited publications and black - listed writers was created in 1950 during the darkest years of Stalinism in Poland with some 1,682 items , and subsequently modified many times by the communist authorities in the Polish People 's Republic . 

Some writers popular before World War II , for example Wacław Kostek - Biernacki who was sentenced to death as an enemy of the state in 1953 , had their books not only removed from libraries , but also meticulously destroyed . 

After the rise of Solidarity movement in 1980 , independent editors were allowed to begin indicating clearly the segments that had been censored instead of hiding such deletions or withdrawing their entire publications . 

The decades of relentless censorship fed the underground press and publications in Poland ( called bibuła in Polish ) . 

In addition to the censorship of the publications , the state also jammed foreign radio stations , such as Radio Free Europe and Voice of America .
