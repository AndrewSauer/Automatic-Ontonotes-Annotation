Little Bay de Noc is a bay in the Upper Peninsula of the U.S. state of Michigan . 

The bay opens into Lake Michigan 's Green Bay . 

The bay , consisting of approximately 30,000 acres ( 120   km² ) , is enclosed by Delta County . 

The cities of Escanaba and Gladstone are on the west side of the bay . 

The bay 's name comes from the Noquet ( or Noc ) Native American people ( thought to have been related to the Menominee of the Algonquian language group ) , who once lived along the shores . 

Douglass Houghton came to Sand Point ( in Escanaba ) in 1844 with his party of government surveyors to chart the land to the north . 

Escanaba has a deep harbor , which made it a lumbering center . 

The first sawmill was built there in 1836 . 

The bay also shipped iron ore from the rich iron ranges in Michigan 's upper peninsula , with the first ore dock built at Escanaba in 1864 . 

Escanaba was incorporated in 1866 . 

A bit further north , Gladstone was founded in 1887 by U.S. 

Senator from Minnesota , William D. Washburn , to serve as a rail - lake terminal for lumber products . 

The Escanaba , Days , Tacoosh , Rapid , and Whitefish rivers all drain into the bay . 

Rapid River marks the mouth of the eponymous river and the head of the bay .
