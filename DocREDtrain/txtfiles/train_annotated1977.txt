Paranephrops is a genus of freshwater crayfish found only in New Zealand . 

They are known as crayfish in New Zealand English and koura ( or kōura ) in Māori ( although both names are also used in New Zealand for the distantly related marine rock lobsters ) . 

The two species are the northern koura , Paranephrops planifrons , found mainly in the North Island , but also in Marlborough , Nelson , and the West Coast of the South Island ; and the southern koura , Paranephrops zealandicus , found only in the eastern and southern of the South Island and on Stewart Island / Rakiura . 

Both species are a traditional food for Māori , and a small koura aquaculture industry supplies the restaurant market .
