Ilves Tampere is a Finnish football club , based in Tampere . 

In the 2018 season they play in the Veikkausliiga , the highest level in Finland . 

They play most of their domestic league games at the Tammela Stadium , with European matches and some domestic games played at the Ratina Stadium . 

In 1974 Ilves - Kissat Tampere and TaPa Tampere merged with Ilves , and the club took Ilves - Kissat 's place in the Mestaruussarja . 

Ilves won the Finnish league championship in 1983 and the Finnish Cup in 1979 and 1990 . 

In the late 1990 's , Ilves suffered financial trouble and its professional team was reformed into Tampere United before the 1999 season . 

The initial plan was to join Ilves with TPV , but TPV decided to continue as its own team . 

As a result , Tampere United inherited Ilves ' place in the second highest division , and Ilves continued to play in lower divisions , although they did not have a men 's team from 1999 to 2007 . 

Ilves has since recovered and was promoted to Ykk√∂nen for the 2013 season . 

Two years later , they got promoted to the highest league after MyPa lost their place .
