John J. Pershing College was a private liberal arts college that operated from 1966 to 1971 in Beatrice , Nebraska , United States . 

Pershing was one of several Midwestern colleges established by local civic leaders with the support and encouragement of Parsons College in Fairfield , Iowa . 

These Parsons " satellite schools " were by - products of the strong growth and apparent success of Parsons during the late 1950s and early 1960s , and all followed the " Parsons Plan " academic model developed at that school . 

None of the schools , however , were ultimately successful . 

The " Parsons Plan " academic model employed at Pershing was the brainchild of Millard Roberts , the president of Parsons College from 1955 to 1967 . 

The multi - faceted plan featured innovative teaching and administrative techniques , and emphasized the recruitment of a geographically and academically diverse student body . 

Among other characteristics , the " Parsons Plan " schools welcomed unconventional students who had not seen success at other colleges . 

In the 1960s , the schools were also attended by a substantial number of young men seeking draft deferments that would allow them to avoid military service during the Vietnam War . 

At least initially , Pershing 's reputation and fortunes were strongly tied to those of Parsons , and when Parsons faltered in the late 1960s the prospects for Pershing and the other Parsons satellite schools grew bleak . 

Although the satellite schools ended their relationships with Parsons , they suffered from a lack of funding , high student turnover , and accreditation issues . 

Ultimately , none of the " Parsons Plan " colleges became economically viable , and all closed by the mid-1970s . 

Pershing College ceased operating in 1971 , and its former site is now occupied by the Beatrice campus of Southeast Community College .
