Notre - Dame de Paris (; ; meaning " Our Lady of Paris " ) , also known as Notre - Dame Cathedral or simply Notre - Dame , is a medieval Catholic cathedral on the Île de la Cité in the fourth arrondissement of Paris , France . 

The cathedral is widely considered to be one of the finest examples of French Gothic architecture . 

The innovative use of the rib vault and flying buttress , the enormous and colorful rose windows , and the naturalism and abundance of its sculptural decoration all set it apart from earlier Romanesque architecture . 

The cathedral was begun in 1160 and largely completed by 1260 , though it was modified frequently in the following centuries . 

In the 1790s , Notre - Dame suffered desecration during the French Revolution when much of its religious imagery was damaged or destroyed . 

Soon after the publication of Victor Hugo 's novel The Hunchback of Notre Dame in 1831 , popular interest in the building revived . 

A major restoration project supervised by Eugène Viollet - le - Duc began in 1845 and continued for twenty - five years . 

Beginning in 1963 , the facade of the Cathedral was cleaned of centuries of soot and grime , returning it to its original color . 

Another campaign of cleaning and restoration was carried out from 1991 - 2000 . 

As the cathedral of the Archdiocese of Paris , Notre - Dame contains the cathedra of the Archbishop of Paris , currently Michel Aupetit . 

12 million people visit Notre - Dame yearly , which makes it the most visited monument in Paris .
