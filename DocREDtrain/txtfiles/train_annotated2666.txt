Ernst Ludwig Gerber ( 29 September 1746 in Sondershausen , Germany – 30 June 1819 in Sondershausen ) was a German composer and author of a famous dictionary of musicians . 

His father , Heinrich Nicolas Gerber ( 1702 - 1775 ) , a pupil of J. S. Bach , was an organist and composer of some distinction , and under his direction Ernst Ludwig at an early age made great progress in his musical studies . 

In 1765 he went to Leipzig to study law , but the claims of music , which had gained additional strength from his acquaintanceship with Johann Adam Hiller , soon came to occupy almost his sole attention . 

On his return to Sondershausen he was appointed music teacher to the children of the prince , and in 1775 he succeeded his father as court organist . 

Afterwards he devoted much of his time to the study of the literature and history of music , and with this view he made himself master of several modern languages . 

His Historisch - biographisches Lexikon der Tonküstler appeared in 1790 and 1792 in two volumes ; and the first volume of what was virtually an improved and corrected edition of this work was published in 1810 under the title Neues Historisch - biographisches Lexikon der Tonküstler , followed by other three volumes in 1812 , 1813 and 1814 . 

Gerber also contributed a number of papers to musical periodicals , and published several minor musical compositions .
