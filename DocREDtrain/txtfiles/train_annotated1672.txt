Barentsøya , sometimes anglicized as Barents Island , is an island in the Svalbard archipelago of Norway , lying between Edgeøya and Spitsbergen . 

Barents Island has no permanent human inhabitants . 

Named for the Dutch explorer Willem Barents ( who actually never sighted the island ) , it is a part of Søraust - Svalbard Nature Reserve . 

Barentsøya is an Arctic island . 

Around 43 per cent of its area of is glaciated . 

To the north , in the sound between Barentsøya and Spitsbergen , lies the island of Kükenthaløya . 

To the south , the sound separating Barents Island from Edgeøya is Freemansundet . 

In geologic time much of the surface rock has been eroded by glaciation . 

The entire area is visited by polar bears , who have a recognisable genetic differentiation specialised to the Barents Sea region . 

At Dørstubukta there is also a large nesting mainly used by kittiwakes .
