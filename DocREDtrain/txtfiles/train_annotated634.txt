Pentti Tapio Akseli Linnosvuo ( 17 March 1933 – 13 July 2010 ) was a Finnish sport shooter . 

Together with Alfred Lane , he is the only Olympic competitor to win gold medals in both 50 m pistol and 25 m rapid fire pistol – the technique differs much between these two events , and hence few modern top - level shooters attempt to excel in both . 

He competed at five consecutive Olympics in 1952 – 1968 , winning two gold medals and a silver . 

Linnosvuo was born in Vaasa , but grew up in Helsinki , where he played ice hockey with Helsingin Jalkapalloklubi , and basketball and football with Sudet . 

He took up shooting aged 15 , first with a rifle , but then changed to pistol , which was easier to handle for a left - handed person . 

In 1951 he won his first national title , and at the 1952 Olympics placed fifth in the 25 m rapid fire event . 

He later won 15 more national titles in 1952 – 1967 and served as the Finnish flag bearer at the 1968 Olympics . 

He took part in five world championships , but medalled only in his first one in 1954 . 

While competing , in 1957–65 Linnosvuo was employed by S Group , a Finnish retailing organization . 

After that he worked with M - real Corporation , a Finnish pulp and paper company , and coached Finnish , West German , Swiss and Norwegian national pistol teams . 

From 1983 to 1999 he served as president of the Finnish Hunting Association and in 1995–98 headed the Finnish Olympic Winners Association .
