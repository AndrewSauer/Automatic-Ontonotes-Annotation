Between June 5 and 6 , 1963 , the Guinean president Sékou Touré made an official visit to Brazzaville , the capital of the Republic of the Congo . 

He was received by the Congolese president Fulbert Youlou . 

The visit sparked protests against the Congolese government , marking a beginning to the popular movement that would end Youlou 's rule two months later . 

Touré 's visit followed a visit by Youlou to Guinea in 1962 . 

During the visit economic cooperation between the two countries was discussed , and Touré pledged that Guinean bauxite and iron would be made available for Congolese needs for industrialization . 

At a speech at the Brazzaville City Hall , Touré denounced the reactionary policies and extravagant lifestyle of the Congolese leadership . 

He called on the peoples to overthrow the regimes of exploiters and imperialist lackeys . 

The speech was met with appalause and praise from Congolese trade unionists , who hailed him with slogans such as ' Long live the president of Africa ! 

Youths and trade unionists took to the streets . 

Slogans raised included ' Long live the independence of Africa ! 

' , ' Down with Fulbert Youlou ! ' 

and ' Down with those who plunder the Congo ' . 

These protests marked the beginning of more politicized trade union militancy . 

Discontent with Youlou 's rule continued to simmer . 

Following Touré 's visit , Youlou sought to reach a compromise with trade unions and youth movements through power - sharing in a provisional government . 

However , on August 13 a strike was declared , and Youlou 's rule was finished during the wave of protests which came to be known as the Trois Glorieuses .
