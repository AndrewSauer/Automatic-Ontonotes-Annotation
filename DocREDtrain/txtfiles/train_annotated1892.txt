The United Nations Security Council " veto power " refers to the power of the permanent members of the UN Security Council ( China , France , Russia , United Kingdom , and United States ) to veto any " substantive " resolution . 

A permanent member 's abstention or absence does not prevent a draft resolution from being adopted . 

This veto power does not apply to " procedural " votes , as determined by the permanent members themselves . 

A permanent member can also block the selection of a Secretary - General , although a formal veto is unnecessary since the vote is taken behind closed doors . 

The unconditional veto possessed by the five governments has been seen by critics as the most undemocratic character of the UN . 

Critics also claim that veto power is the main cause for international inaction on war crimes and crimes against humanity . 

However , the United States refused to join the United Nations in 1945 unless it was given a veto . 

The absence of the United States from the League of Nations contributed to its ineffectiveness . 

Supporters of the veto power regard it as a promoter of international stability , a check against military interventions , and a critical safeguard against U.S. domination .
