The Occupation of the Hainburger Au wetlands in December 1984 marked a turning point for awareness in German speaking central Europe and was of great significance for the development of democratic processes in Austria . 

The Hainburger Au is a large naturally occurring flood plain bordering the River Danube at , and upstream of , Hainburg in Lower Austria . 

It is a short distance to the east of Vienna 's main airport . 

Since 1996 it has been part of the Danube - Auen National Park . 

In February 1983 the of the World Wide Fund for Nature ( WWF ) began a campaign under the slogan " Rettet die Auen " to preserve the Hainburger Au flood plain . 

With the help of various media channels the WWF began to publicise the threat of impending destruction for a large part of the region . 

The threat came from plans , which at the end of 1984 still enjoyed the full support of the Austrian government , to construct a hydro - electric power plant . 

As events unfolded , the nature of the protesters ' demonstrations and a mass - occupation of the threatened area changed peoples ' understanding of democracy as well as national energy policy in Austria .
