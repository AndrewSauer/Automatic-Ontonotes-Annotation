Demi - Gods and Semi - Devils is a wuxia novel by Jin Yong ( Louis Cha ) . 

It was first serialised concurrently from 3 September 1963 to 27 May 1966 in the newspapers Ming Pao in Hong Kong and Nanyang Siang Pau in Singapore . 

It has since spawned adaptations in film and television in Hong Kong , mainland China and Taiwan . 

The novel 's title has been a challenge for translators for years . 

An alternative English title is Eight Books of the Heavenly Dragon . 

The major characters are based on eight races of demi - gods and semi - devils described in Buddhist cosmology . 

In Buddhism , these demi - gods and semi - devils are markedly different from the human race but are still bound to Saṃsāra by their own desires . 

Jin originally modelled each major character after one of the races but , as he continued writing , the complexity of the story made it impossible for such a simplistic mapping .
