The military reforms of the Florentine Republic were initiated by Florentine politician and political theorist Niccol√≤ Machiavelli during the short - lived Republic of Florence that lasted from 1498 to 1512 under the priest Girolamo Savonarola . 

In the pursuit of the republican spirit which pervaded Florence at the time , Machiavelli sought to establish a military establishment that was similar to that of ancient Rome . 

He was specifically focused upon the establishment of an army possessed with the discipline of the Roman legions . 

He sought to establish a citizen - infantry capable of taking the field against the Italian Condottieri of the day , who largely terrorized the peninsula , in addition to the chronic foreign invasions which occurred on a regular basis at this time . 

Broadly speaking Machiavelli would institute a series of reforms in 1506 that would create a citizen army of 20,000 men , and establish a system that would keep this citizen army in a state of readiness .
