Iñaki Ochoa de Olza ( May 29 , 1967 in Pamplona , Navarre – May 23 , 2008 in Annapurna , Nepal ) was a Spanish mountaineer , alpinist and climber . 

Ochoa de Olza took part in more than thirty separate climbing expeditions in the Himalayas over the course of his career , and he was involved in more than 200 expeditions as a guide . 

His records included climbing 12 of the world 's 14 tallest mountains ( repeating one of them , Cho Oyu ) without the aid of oxygen . 

Ochoa went on record as saying that he did not believe in using oxygen to climb mountains , claiming " if you use oxygen , you are not an alpinist , you are more of an astronaut or a scuba diver . " . 

He died of pulmonary edema in May 2008 while attempting to climb Annapurna ( which would have been his 13th eight thousander ) .
