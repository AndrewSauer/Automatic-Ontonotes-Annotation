The mbira ( pronounced UM - beer - ra , IPA ( ə)mˈbɪərə ) is an African musical instrument consisting of a wooden board ( often fitted with a resonator ) with attached staggered metal tines , played by holding the instrument in the hands and plucking the tines with the thumbs . 

The mbira is usually classified as part of the lamellaphone family and part of the idiophone family of musical instruments . 

Members of this broad family of instruments are known by a wide variety of names . 

In the Anglo world it is often called a thumb piano , as well as marímbula ( also kalimba ) in the Caribbean Islands . 

Both Joseph H. Howard , owner of the largest collection of drums and ancillary folk instruments in the Americas , and Nigerian drummer Babatunde Olatunji argue that the mbira is thoroughly African , being found only in areas populated by Africans or their descendants . 

In Eastern and Southern Africa , there are many kinds of mbira , often accompanied by the hosho , a percussion instrument . 

The mbira was reported to be used in Okpuje , Nsukka area of the south eastern part of Nigeria in the early 1900s . 

It is a particularly common musical instrument of the Democratic Republic of Congo and the Shona people of Zimbabwe . 

It is also often an important instrument to be played at religious ceremonies , weddings , and other social gatherings . 

Mbira came to prominence after the worldwide stage performance and recordings of Thomas Mapfumo on the 1980s , whose music is based on and includes the mbira ; the work of Dumisani Maraire , who brought marimba and karimba music to the American Pacific Northwest ; Ephat Mujuru , who was one of the pioneer teachers of mbira in the US ; as well as the writings and recordings of Zimbabwean musicians made by Paul Berliner . 

Commercially produced mbiras were exported from South Africa by ethnomusicologist Hugh Tracey from the 1950s onward , popularizing the instrument outside Africa .
