Kamehameha Highway is one of the main highways serving suburban and rural O‘ahu in the U.S. state of Hawaii . 

Starting from Nimitz Highway near Pearl Harbor and Hickam Air Force Base in Honolulu , it serves the island 's older western suburbs , turning north across the O‘ahu Central Valley to the North Shore . 

At the North Shore , Kamehameha Highway heads northeast around the northern tip of O‘ahu , then southeast to and just beyond Kāne‘ohe Bay on the windward coast . 

The road was named after King Kamehameha I. 

A short detached segment of the Kamehameha Highway exists for a few blocks in the Honolulu neighborhood of Kalihi . 

This segment runs as a short extension of Dillingham Boulevard from Puuhale Road ( near the Oahu Community Correctional Center ) to exit 18B on Interstate H-1 . 

This section was contiguous with the rest of the highway before the construction of the H-1 viaduct .
