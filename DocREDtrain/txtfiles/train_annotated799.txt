Natural horror ( also known as creature features ) is a subgenre of horror films that features natural forces , typically in the form of animals or plants , that pose a threat to human characters . 

Though killer animals in film have existed since the release of The Lost World in 1925 , two of the first motion pictures to garner mainstream success with a " nature run amok " premise were The Birds , directed by Alfred Hitchcock and released in 1963 ; and Jaws , directed by Steven Spielberg and released in 1975 . 

Following Jaws , numerous horror films of a similar narrative were produced , including Grizzly ( 1976 ) , Piranha ( 1978 ) , and Alligator ( 1980 ) . 

Today , natural horror films are still produced , with varying tones , such as ( 2008 ) and The Shallows ( 2016 ) .
