The President of Harvard University is the chief administrator of the university and the ex officio chairman of the Harvard Corporation . 

Each is appointed by and is responsible to the other members of that body , who delegate to the president the day - to - day running of the university . 

Harvard is a famously decentralized university , noted for the " every tub on its own bottom " independence of its various constituent faculties . 

They set their own academic standards and manage their own budgets . 

The president , however , plays an important part in university - wide planning and strategy . 

Each names a faculty 's dean ( and , since the foundation of the office in 1994 , the university 's provost ) , and grants tenure to recommended professors ; however , he or she is expected to make such decisions after extensive consultation with faculty members . 

Harvard presidents have traditionally influenced educational practices nationwide . 

Charles W. Eliot , for example , originated America 's familiar system of a smorgasbord of elective courses available to each student ; James B. Conant worked to introduce standardized testing ; Derek Bok and Neil L. Rudenstine argued for the continued importance of diversity in higher education . 

Recently , however , the job has become increasingly administrative , especially as fund - raising campaigns have taken on central importance in large institutions such as Harvard . 

Some have criticized this trend to the extent it has prevented the president from focusing on substantive issues in higher education . 

Each president is professor in some department of the university and teaches from time to time . 

Harvard 's current president is Lawrence Bacow , formerly the president of Tufts University .
