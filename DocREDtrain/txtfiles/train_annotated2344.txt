The Violin Concerto in A minor , Op . 

53 ( B.108 ) , is a concerto for violin and orchestra composed by Antonín Dvořák in 1879 . 

It was premiered in Prague in 1883 by František Ondříček , who also gave the Vienna and London premieres . 

Today it remains an important work in the violin repertoire . 

The concerto is scored for solo violin and an orchestra consisting of 2 flutes , 2 oboes 2 clarinets ( in A ) , 2 bassoons , 4 horns , 2 trumpets , timpani , and strings . 

Its structure is the classical three movements , fast – slow – fast . 

The first movement and the second movement are interconnected ( attacca subito ) . 

Dvořák was inspired to write the concerto after meeting Joseph Joachim in 1878 , and composed the work with the intention of dedicating it to him . 

However , when he finished the concerto in 1879 , Joachim became skeptical about it . 

Joachim was a strict classicist and objected , inter alia , to Dvořák 's abrupt truncation of the first movement 's orchestral tutti . 

Joachim also did n't like the fact that the recapitulation was cut short and that it led directly to the slow second movement . 

It is also assumed that he was upset with the persistent repetition found in the third movement . 

However , Joachim never said anything outright and instead claimed to be editing the solo part . 

He never actually performed the piece in public . 

The concerto was first performed in the United States on October 30 , 1891 , at the Auditorium Theatre in Chicago . 

Max Bendix was soloist with the Chicago Orchestra led by Theodore Thomas .
