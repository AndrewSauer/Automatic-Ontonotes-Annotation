Dennis Carl Wilson ( December 4 , 1944   – December 28 , 1983 ) was an American musician , singer , and songwriter who co - founded the Beach Boys . 

He is best remembered as their drummer and as the middle brother of bandmates Brian and Carl Wilson . 

Dennis was the only true surfer in the Beach Boys , and his personal life exemplified the " California Myth " that the band 's early songs often celebrated . 

He was also known for his brief association with Charles Manson , a songwriter and cult leader who was later convicted of several murders . 

Wilson served mainly on drums and backing vocals for the Beach Boys , and contrary to popular belief , his playing can be heard on many of the group 's hits . 

He originally had few lead vocals on the band 's songs , but starting with their 1968 album Friends , his prominence as a singer - songwriter increased . 

Unlike Brian 's music , Dennis ' is characterized for reflecting his " edginess " and " little of his happy charm " . 

His original songs for the group included " Little Bird " ( 1968 ) , " Forever " ( 1970 ) , and " Slip On Through " ( 1970 ) . 

Friends and biographers also credit Wilson as a ghost co - writer on " You Are So Beautiful " , a hit for Joe Cocker in 1974 . 

During his final years , Wilson struggled with heroin and cocaine addictions that contributed to tensions with his bandmates . 

His only solo album , Pacific Ocean Blue ( 1977 ) , was released to warm reviews , but moderate sales . 

One writer retrospectively described it as " Kurt Cobain produced by Phil Spector . " 

Sessions for a follow - up , Bambu , disintegrated before his death . 

In 1988 , Wilson was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of the Beach Boys . 

He died from drowning at the age of 39 in 1983 .
