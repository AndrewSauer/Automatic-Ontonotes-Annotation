Susannah Maria Cibber ( February 1714 â€“ 30 January 1766 ) , also known as Susannah Maria Arne , was a celebrated English singer and actress and the sister of the composer Thomas Arne . 

Although she began her career as a soprano , her voice lowered in the early part of her career to that of a true contralto . 

She was universally admired for her ability to move her audiences emotionally both as an actress and vocalist . 

Possessing a sweet , expressive , and agile singing voice with a wide vocal range , Cibber was an immensely popular singer , even if at times her voice was criticized for a lack of polished technique . 

Charles Burney wrote of her singing that " by a natural pathos , and perfect conception of the words , she often penetrated the heart , when others , with infinitely greater voice and skill , could only reach the ear . " 

Cibber was particularly admired by Handel , who wrote numerous parts especially for her including the contralto arias in his 1741 oratorio Messiah , the role of Micah in Samson , the role of Lichas in Hercules and the role of David in Saul among others . 

In the mid-1730s she began appearing in plays in addition to appearing in operas and oratorios . 

She became the greatest dramatic actress of the eighteenth - century London stage and at the time of her death was the highest - paid actress in England .
