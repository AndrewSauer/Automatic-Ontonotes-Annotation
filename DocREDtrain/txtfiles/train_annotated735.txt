Empress Dowager Zhang ( 張太后 , personal name unknown ) ( died 426 ) was an empress dowager of the Chinese dynasty Liu Song . 

She was the mother of Emperor Shao ( Liu Yifu ) and a concubine of Emperor Wu ( Liu Yu ) . 

In 406 , she gave birth to Liu Yifu , the oldest son of Liu Yu , who was then already a paramount general of Jin . 

She later also gave birth to a daughter , Liu Huiyuan ( 劉惠媛 , the later Princess Yixing ) . 

In 420 , after Liu Yu seized the throne from Emperor Gong of Jin and established Liu Song as its emperor , he created her an imperial consort , but not an empress , as she was not his wife . 

He created her son Liu Yifu as crown prince . 

After Emperor Wu died in 422 , Liu Yifu succeeded him as Emperor Shao , and Emperor Shao honored her as empress dowager . 

In 424 , Emperor Shao was deposed by officials that Emperor Wu had left in charge of the government , who believed that he was unfit to be emperor , and soon they killed him . 

They made his capable younger brother Liu Yilong , by a different mother , emperor ( as Emperor Wen ) instead . 

Initially , Empress Dowager Zhang returned her empress dowager seal and moved to Wu Commandery ( around present - day Suzhou , Jiangsu ) , where her son was exiled and killed . 

After Emperor Wen arrived in Jiankang and assumed the throne , he honored her as Princess Dowager of Yingyang ( as Emperor Shao carried the title Prince of Yingyang between his removal and his death ) . 

She died in 426 , after having seen her son 's killers largely killed by Emperor Wen earlier that year .
