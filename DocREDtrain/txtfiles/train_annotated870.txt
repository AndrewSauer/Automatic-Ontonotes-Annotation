Directorio Revolucionario Estudiantil ( DRE ) ( English : Student Revolutionary Directorate ) 

was a Cuban student group which in opposition to Cuban dictator Fulgencio Batista from 1954 to 1957 played a role in the Cuban Revolution , which came to power in 1959 . 

In 1960 , the Directorio was relaunched in opposition to Fidel Castro and moved its base to the United States , where it soon developed links with the Central Intelligence Agency . 

In August 1962 it carried out an attack on a beachfront Havana hotel . 

As of 1963 it was the largest anti - Castro student group in Miami ; it also had a chapter in New Orleans , where it had contact with Lee Harvey Oswald in mid-1963 . 

Immediately after the 22 November 1963 assassination of John F. Kennedy , it launched a campaign asserting that Lee Harvey Oswald had been acting on behalf of the Cuban government . 

The group lost its CIA support in December 1966 .
