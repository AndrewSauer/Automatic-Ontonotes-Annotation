Ignazio Cerio ( 1841 – 1921 ) was an influential but eccentric physician and amateur philosopher on the island of Capri , in Italy . 

His father , imprisoned for his liberal beliefs , had spent his time in jail devising chemical concoctions and mechanical constructions that would never be made ; Ignazio continued the family traditions of both liberalism and idiosyncratic inventiveness . 

Ignazio even coined the word disutilità to refer to a human life lacking a sense of purpose but full of tension and reflection , mixing passionate pursuit of ideas with periods of lovesickness and ennui . 

He worked for fifty years as a medical doctor on Capri , a profession he followed with his characteristically unconventional flair . 

On one occasion , for example , he established a sanitorium at Pozzuoli , claiming that the sulphurous gases would cure tuberculosis . 

The only patient to arrive at the sanitorium rejected the doctor 's contention that both sulphur and arsenic would be good for the health . 

Nevertheless , he remains a well - remembered and much - loved figure on the island of Capri , his memory immortalised both in the writings of his son , Edwin Cerio ( particularly in La vita a la figura de un uomo ( 1921 ) ) and in the cultural Centro Caprense Ignazio Cerio , established in his name to organise conferences and meetings on medicine , Italian and foreign literature , archaeology , palaeontology , and international and local history . 

Palazzo Cerio , close to the Piazzetta , hosts the Ignazio Cerio museum about Capri 's natural history .
