Midnight at the Lost and Found is a 1983 album by Meat Loaf . 

This would be the final Meat Loaf release under Epic Records until The Very Best of Meat Loaf ( 1998 ) . 

Following a dispute with his former songwriter Jim Steinman , Meat Loaf was contractually obliged to release a new album . 

According to Meat Loaf , Steinman gave him " Total Eclipse of the Heart " and " Making Love Out of Nothing at All " for the album , but Meat Loaf 's record company refused to pay for Steinman . 

The songs Steinman had given to Meat Loaf were then given to Bonnie Tyler and Air Supply respectively , which both became hits in their respective countries and worldwide . 

Struggling for time and with no resolution to his arguments with Steinman seemingly on the horizon ( eventually , Steinman and Meat Loaf would sue one another ) , he was forced to find songwriters wherever he could , including writing the songs himself . 

Meat Loaf is credited with being involved in the writing of numerous tracks on the album , including the title track . 

However , as Meat would later admit , he was not much of a songwriter and did not like the songs he had written for the album . 

It was also regarded by fans and critics alike as a poor effort whether compared to previous releases or on its own merit . 

Those same fans and critics were disappointed to see that the iconic pictures on the covers of Bat Out of Hell and Dead Ringer were replaced by a black - and - white photograph of Meat Loaf . 

( On some later re - releases , a color image of a screaming Meat Loaf was used as the cover image . )
