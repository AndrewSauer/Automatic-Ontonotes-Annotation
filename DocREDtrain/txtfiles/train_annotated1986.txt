Night Over Water is a politically minded novel written by author Ken Follett and published by William Morrow in 1991 . 

It was reprinted as a paperback book in the United States in 1992 . 

Night Over Water is a fictionalized account of the final flight of the Pan American Clipper passenger airplane during the first few days of World War II , early September , 1939 . 

Follett is careful to state that , though the flight and all of the characters are fictional the plane , a Boeing 314 , was real and was nicknamed the " Pan Am Clipper . " 

It was a seaplane , an aircraft that landed in the sea , not on an airstrip , powered by 4 propeller engines . 

It was capable of crossing the Atlantic Ocean in little more than 24 hours with intermediate stops in Shannon Estuary at Foynes , Ireland , Bay of Exploits at Botwood , Newfoundland and Shediac Bay , Canada , at each of which stop Follett adds a scene or two of intrigue . 

This route made the Pan Am Clipper the fastest mode of transatlantic travel at the time â€” and very appealing to those who wanted to escape from Britain before the start of the war . 

The tale begins with several separated threads , telling the individual stories of the people who later all end up in this last flight to New York . 

Though Follett manages to bundle all these together , the events the characters share while travelling with the clipper are still told through the perspectives introduced before . 

Each of these main characters is heading for his own interests in the beginning but soon they melt together . 

The theme is the importance of recognizing the threat of totalitarianism and also a feminist message of women standing up for themselves .
