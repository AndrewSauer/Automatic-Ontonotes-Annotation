Joseph Isaac Clanton ( 1847 â€“ June 1 , 1887 ) was a member of a loose association of outlaws known as The Cowboys who clashed with lawmen Wyatt , Virgil and Morgan Earp as well as Doc Holliday . 

On October 26 , 1881 , Clanton was present at the Gunfight at the O.K. 

Corral in the boomtown of Tombstone , Arizona Territory but was unarmed and ran from the gunfight , in which his 19-year - old brother , Billy , was killed . 

Clanton filed murder charges against the Earps and Holliday but after a 30-day preliminary hearing , Justice Wells Spicer ruled that the lawmen had acted within their lawful duty . 

Clanton was implicated in the attempted assassination of Virgil Earp on December 30 , 1881 but other Cowboys provided an alibi and he was released . 

Six years later Clanton was killed attempting to flee when he was shot by a lawman seeking to arrest him for cattle - rustling .
