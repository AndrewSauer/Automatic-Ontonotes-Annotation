Ulver ( Norwegian for wolves ) are a Norwegian experimental musical collective founded in 1993 , by vocalist Kristoffer Rygg . 

Their early works , such as debut album Bergtatt , were categorised as folklore - influenced black metal , but the band has since evolved a fluid and increasingly eclectic musical style , blending genres such as rock , electronica , symphonic and chamber traditions , noise , progressive and experimental music into their oeuvre . 

1997 marked their international debut with the release of their third album Nattens madrigal through German label Century Media . 

However , following discord with the label , Kristoffer Rygg formed his own imprint , Jester Records , in 1998 . 

British composer and multi - instrumentalist Daniel O'Sullivan joined the collective in 2009 , and the band performed some of their first live concerts in their 15-year lifespan , including the prestigious Norwegian National Opera . 

Ulver have sold in excess of half a million records , been twice nominated for the Norwegian Grammy Awards , Spellemannsprisen , in different categories , won Album of the Year at the Oslo Awards for Shadows of the Sun in 2008 , won the NATT&DAG ; award for Best Live Act in 2011 , and earned a global reputation for stylistic unpredictability . 

Harmony Korine , the controversial director of films like Gummo , commented : " There 's a real lineage from a composer like Wagner to a band like Ulver . " 

Author and musician Julian Cope has said , " Ulver are cataloguing the death of our culture two decades before anyone else has noticed its inevitable demise . "
