Almost two months prior to the album 's official release date of June 12 , the album was leaked and began appearing on P2P sites . 

The album features guest vocals by Killswitch Engage frontman Howard Jones on the track " Elysium " , as well as Jonah Jenkins ( vocalist of Milligram and ex - vocalist of Only Living Witness ) on the track " We Can not Deny " . 

Crazyfists front man , Lindow , was pleased with Jenkins appearance on the album and said , in an interview , " Only Living Witness was one of our favorite bands growing up , so we really wanted him to be on the record . 

Over the years , I made friends with him online , which is a little weird . 

But he lives in Boston so he came down to New Jersey when we were recording , and that was awesome . " 

The first single released from the album was " I 'll Go Until My Heart Stops " .
