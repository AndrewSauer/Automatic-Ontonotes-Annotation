A bad quarto , in Shakespearean scholarship , is a quarto - sized publication of one of Shakespeare 's plays that is considered spurious , pirated from a theatre without permission by someone in the audience writing it down as it was spoken or written down later by an actor or group of actors , which , according to a theory , has been termed " memorial reconstruction " . 

Since the quarto derives from performance and lacks a direct link to the author 's original manuscript , the text would be expected to contain corruptions , abridgements and paraphrasings . 

That is in contrast to a " good quarto " , which is considered to be a text that is authorised , one that may have been printed from the author 's manuscript , or a scribal copy or prompt copy that is based on the author 's manuscript . 

" Bad quartos " are considered to include the first quartos of Romeo and Juliet , Henry V , The Merry Wives of Windsor , and Hamlet . 

The concept has expanded to include quartos of plays by other Elizabethan authors , including Peele 's The Battle of Alcazar , Greene 's Orlando Furioso , and the collaborative script , Sir Thomas More . 

The theory has been accepted , studied and expanded by many scholars , but some scholars do not accept it and those , such as Eric Sams , consider the entire theory to be without foundation . 

Jonathan Bate states that " late twentieth- and early twenty - first century scholars have begun to question the whole edifice " .
