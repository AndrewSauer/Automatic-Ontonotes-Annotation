Federal Heights is a neighborhood in Salt Lake City , Utah . 

It is generally considered as the residential area to the east of Virginia Street and to the north of South Temple Street in Salt Lake City . 

It abuts the Wasatch Mountains to the north , and the University of Utah to the south and east . 

Federal Heights is one of the most affluent neighborhoods in Salt Lake City . 

Many of the homes in the area date to the early 1900s . 

The name " Federal Heights " originates from the period between the Mormon settlers ' establishment of Salt Lake City in 1847 and Utah 's admittance to the United States as a state in 1896 . 

During this period of time , the Federal Government of the United States established Fort Douglas in the foothills of the Wasatch Mountains above Salt Lake City ( not far from the present - day neighborhood ) in order to keep an eye on the settlers . 

Through the efforts of Utah 's U.S. 

Senator Thomas Kearns ( 1901 - 1905 ) , Fort Douglas became a regimental post . The officers of the fort established their homesteads to the north - east , creating the Federal Heights neighborhood . 

It gained notoriety when Elizabeth Smart disappeared from the neighborhood on June 5 , 2002 , and was later rescued ( March 12 , 2003 ) from her abductors , two homeless adults known as Brian David Mitchell and Wanda Ileen Barzee .
