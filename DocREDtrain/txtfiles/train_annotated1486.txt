Salammbô ( 1862 ) is a historical novel by Gustave Flaubert . 

It is set in Carthage during the 3rd century BC , immediately before and during the Mercenary Revolt which took place shortly after the First Punic War . 

Flaubert 's main source was Book I of Polybius 's Histories . 

The novel kickstarted a renewed interest in the history of the pre - Imperial Rome 's conflict with the North African Phoenician colony of Carthage . 

Flaubert 's contemporary readers , familiar with his previous realistic work Madame Bovary , were shocked and , in some instances , even appalled by the indiscriminate violence and sensuality prevalent all throughout the novel which is why , notwithstanding the praise it received for the style it was written in as well as the story it tells , Salammbô remains controversial among the literary circles even to this day . 

Regardless , it was a massive best - seller which sealed the author 's reputation as one of the most prominent French writers of the 19th century , with even some of the Carthaginian costumes described in it making an impact on the contemporary fashion in France . 

Since then , however , it has fallen into obscurity in much of the Anglophone world .
