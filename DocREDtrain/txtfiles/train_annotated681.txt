The Book of Abraham is an 1835 work produced by the Latter Day Saints ( LDS ) movement founder Joseph Smith that he said was based on Egyptian papyri purchased from a traveling mummy exhibition . 

According to Smith , the book was " a translation of some ancient records ... purporting to be the writings of Abraham , while he was in Egypt , called the Book of Abraham , written by his own hand , upon papyrus " . 

The work was first published in 1842 and today is a canonical part of the Pearl of Great Price . 

Since its printing , the Book of Abraham has been a source of controversy . 

Non - LDS Egyptologists , beginning in the late-19th century , have heavily criticized Joseph Smith 's explanations of the facsimiles , with many stating that his interpretations are entirely inaccurate . 

They have also asserted that damaged portions of the papyri have been reconstructed incorrectly . 

The controversy intensified in the late 1960s when portions of the Joseph Smith Papyri were located . 

Translations of the papyri revealed the rediscovered portions bore no relation to the Book of Abraham text . 

LDS apologist Hugh Nibley and Brigham Young University Egyptologists John L. Gee and Michael D. Rhodes subsequently offered detailed rebuttals to some criticisms . 

University of Chicago Egyptologist Robert K. Ritner concluded in 2014 that the source of the Book of Abraham " is the ' Breathing Permit of HÃ´r , ' misunderstood and mistranslated by Joseph Smith . " 

He later said the Book of Abraham is now " confirmed as a perhaps well - meaning , but erroneous invention by Joseph Smith , " and " despite its inauthenticity as a genuine historical narrative , the Book of Abraham remains a valuable witness to early American religious history and to the recourse to ancient texts as sources of modern religious faith and speculation .
