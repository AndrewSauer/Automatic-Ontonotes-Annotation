The Sorcerer 's Hat was the icon of Disney 's Hollywood Studios , the third of four theme parks built at the Walt Disney World Resort in Bay Lake , Florida , from 2001 to 2015 . 

The structure was inspired by " The Sorcerer 's Apprentice " segment in Walt Disney 's 1940 animated film , Fantasia . 

Mickey Mouse 's gloved hand and ears underneath the hat are visible emerging from the ground . 

With its opening on September 28 , 2001 , it replaced the Earffel Tower as the park 's icon in marketing material . 

It was used as a venue for pin trading and sales , and also served as a backdrop to many special events and shows . 

High School Musical Live culminated several dances from several Disney Channel shows that performed several times daily in front of the hat . 

Disney characters made meet - and - greet appearances around the hat throughout the day .
