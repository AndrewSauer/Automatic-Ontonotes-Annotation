Ladies Night is the third studio album by English girl group Atomic Kitten released on 10 November 2003 . 

" If You Come to Me " was released as the lead single from the album on 27 October 2003 followed by the second single " Ladies ' Night " featuring Kool & the Gang , which was released on 15 December 2003 . 

The third and final single " Someone like Me " was released on 29 March 2004 and was the group 's official last single following the announcement of their indefinite hiatus , although the album version of the single only contains Liz McClarnon 's vocals . 

" Be with You " is featured on the album but not listed as a single from the album due to being released a year earlier as a double A - side single with " The Last Goodbye " , which featured on the group 's second album Feels So Good ( 2002 ) . 

The album did not sell as well as their two preceding albums ( which were both certified Double Platinum in the UK ) , but still reached number 5 on the UK Album Chart and achieved Platinum status .
