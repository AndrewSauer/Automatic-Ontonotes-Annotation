The Battle class were a class of destroyers of the British Royal Navy ( RN ) and Royal Australian Navy ( RAN ) , named after naval or other battles fought by British or English forces . 

Built in three groups , the first group were ordered under the 1942 naval estimates . 

A modified second and third group , together with two ships of an extended design were planned for the 1943 and 1944 estimates . 

Most of these ships were cancelled when it became apparent that the war was being won and the ships would not be required , although two ships of the third group , ordered for the RAN , were not cancelled and were subsequently completed in Australia . 

Seven Battles were commissioned before the end of World War II , but only saw action , with the British Pacific Fleet .
