Edward Purcell ( 1689 â€“ 1740 ) was an English organist and composer . 

Purcell was born in Westminster , London , the only surviving son of the English Baroque master , Henry Purcell , who died in 1695 when Edward was a small child . 

When his mother Frances died in February 1706 , she stated in her will , and apparently in accordance with her husband 's wishes , that she had given him a good education . 

She also bequeathed to him music and instruments : " the organ , the double spinnet , the single spinnet " ; possibly the instruments her husband had used . 

Edward became organist of St Clement Eastcheap , in London at the end of 1711 , a position he retained for the rest of his life . 

He was unsuccessful in his attempts to succeed his uncle Daniel Purcell as organist of St Andrew 's , Holborn , on 19 February 1718 and again on 3 April 1719 . 

He eventually became organist at St. Margaret 's , Westminster , on 8 July 1726 , concurrent with his post at Eastcheap . 

In 1739 , the year before his death , he was one of the founder - members of the London - based musicians ' benevolent society then known as the Society of Musicians ( later to become the Royal Society of Musicians ) . 

He was buried in St Clement Eastcheap near the organ gallery door , and was succeeded as organist there by his son Edward Henry Purcell ( d. 1765 ) . 

Edward Purcell published two songs , though the psalm chants often attributed to him seem to be by an earlier namesake , perhaps his uncle Edward .
