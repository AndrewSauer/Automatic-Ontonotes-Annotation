Haps Magazine , also known as " HAPS " , is an English online magazine located in Busan , South Korea that focuses on lifestyle , entertainment and expat life on the Korean peninsula . 

It was founded in 2009 and has become one of Korea 's most popular English resources for news and information . 

While the focus of the magazine is mostly on events and happenings around the Busan and southeastern areas of Korea , the magazine has claimed some international fame for some of its articles . 

Editor - in - Chief Bobby McGill 's report on K - pop singer   Psy 's past anti - American actions saw numerous international media outlets including TIME , The Washington Post and the New York Post help break the story which made the " Gangnam Style " legend apologize for his actions . 

HAPS also received more international attention when a report about South Korean baseball player Kim Tae - kyun made insensitive remarks towards African - American pitcher Shane Youman . 

The report helped contribute to the National Human Rights Commission of Korea demanding sensitivity training education to prevent similar racial discrimination remarks among sports professionals in Korea .
