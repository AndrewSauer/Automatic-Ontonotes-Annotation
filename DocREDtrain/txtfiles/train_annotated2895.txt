Ekusher Gaan ( " The Song of Twentyfirst " ) , more popularly known ( after its first line ) as Amar Bhaier Rokte Rangano ( " My Brothers ' Blood Spattered " ) is a Bengali song written by Abdul Gaffar Choudhury to mark the Bengali Language Movement in 1952 East Pakistan . 

It was first published anonymously in the last page of a newspaper with the headline Ekusher Gaan , but was later published in Ekusheys February edition . 

The song was initially written as a poem at the bedside of an injured language movement activist who was shot by the Pakistani military police . 

The cultural secretary of the Jubo League gave the poem to Abdul Latif to put to a tune , which Latif Atikul Islam first sang . 

The students of Dhaka College also sung the song when they attempted to build a Shaheed Minar on their college premises , getting them expelled from the college . 

Altaf Mahmud , a renowned composer and a martyr of the Bangladesh Liberation War , recomposed the song using Abdul Latif 's version , which is now a quasi - official tune . 

The song is often recognized as the most influential song of the language movement , reminding numerous Bangladeshis about the conflicts of 1952 . 

Every 21 February sees people from all parts of the Bangladesh heading to the Shaheed Minar in the probhat feri , a barefoot march to the monument , paying homage to those killed in the language movement demonstrations by singing this song . 

It is regarded by the listeners of BBC Bengali Service as the third best song in Bengali .
