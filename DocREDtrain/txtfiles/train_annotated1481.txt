Jean IV de Brosse ( 1505 in Lamballe – 1564 ) was the son of René de Brosse and Jeanne de Commines ( daughter of Philippe de Commines ) . 

After the death of his father at the Battle of Pavia , he succeeded him as Count of Penthièvre . 

In 1533 , he married Anne de Pisseleu d'Heilly , the mistress of Francis I of France , and was shortly thereafter created Count , then Duke of Étampes . 

However , he was greatly impoverished by the expenditures necessary to maintain their position at court . 

With the death of Francis I , the antipathy of Diane de Poitiers compelled Jean to retreat to Brittany , where he had been appointed governor in 1543 ; she also obtained his duchy of Étampes . 

After the death of Henry II of France and the fall of Diane , he was able to regain the duchy , but died not long thereafter .
