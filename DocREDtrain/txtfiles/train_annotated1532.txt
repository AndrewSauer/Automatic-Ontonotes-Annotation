The Hauka movement was a religious movement which arose in French Colonial Africa . 

It consisted of ceremonies , including mimicry and dancing , in which the participants performed the elaborate military ceremonies of their colonial occupiers . 

It was depicted in Les Maîtres Fous ( The Mad Masters – 1955 ) , a short film directed by Jean Rouch , a well - known French film director and ethnologist . 

According to some anthropologists , the movement was a form of resistance that began in Niger , but spread to other parts of Africa . 

According to some anthropologists , this pageant , though historic , was largely done to mock their authority by stealing their powers . 

Hauka members were not trying to emulate Europeans , but were trying to extract their life force . 

This stance has been heavily criticized by anthropologist James G. Ferguson , who finds this imitation not about importing colonialism into indigenous culture , but as a way to gain rights and status in the colonial society . 

The adoption of European customs was not a form of resistance , but to be “ respected by the Europeans . ”
