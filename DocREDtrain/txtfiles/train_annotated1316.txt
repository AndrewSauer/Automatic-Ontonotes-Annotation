Lesbian , gay , bisexual , and transgender ( LGBT ) persons in Kiribati face legal challenges not experienced by non - LGBT residents . 

Male homosexuality is illegal in Kiribati . 

Female homosexuality is legal , but lesbians may face violence and discrimination . 

However , employment discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation is prohibited . 

In November 2016 , Kiribati voted against a plan to get rid of the UN Independent Expert on violence and discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity at the United Nations General Assembly . 

The push to get rid of the UN expert failed 84 - 77 . 

Kiribati along with Sri Lanka were the only two countries , where homosexuality is still criminalised , who voted against the proposal .
