Dow v Black is a Canadian constitutional law court decision . 

It was one of the first major cases examining in detail the division of powers between the federal Parliament and the provincial Legislatures , set out in s. 91 and s. 92 of the Constitution Act , 1867 ( formerly known as the British North America Act , 1867 ) . 

The case was decided by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council , at that time the court of last resort for Canada within the British Empire , on appeal from the Supreme Court of New Brunswick . 

The case considered the constitutionality of a provincial statute which authorised the inhabitants of the parish of St. Stephen , New Brunswick to issue a debenture as an inducement to a railway company to build a railway connecting an 8-mile section from Debec , New Brunswick to the town of Houlton , Maine , in the United States . 

The Supreme Court of New Brunswick held that the statute was unconstitutional , since it intruded on the exclusive federal jurisdiction over inter - jurisdictional railways . 

The Judicial Committee allowed an appeal from the Supreme Court of New Brunswick and held that the legislation was within provincial jurisdiction as a matter of local taxation , coming under sections 92(2 ) and 92(16 ) of the Constitution Act , 1867 . 

The statute did not intrude on federal jurisdiction over inter - jurisdictional railways , under s. 91(29 ) and s. 92(10 ) of the Constitution Act , 1867 .
