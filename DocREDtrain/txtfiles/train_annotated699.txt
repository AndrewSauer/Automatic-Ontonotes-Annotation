The Inventions and Sinfonias , BWV 772–801 , also known as the Two- and Three - Part Inventions , are a collection of thirty short keyboard compositions by Johann Sebastian Bach ( 1685 – 1750 ) : 15 inventions , which are two - part contrapuntal pieces , and 15 sinfonias , which are three - part contrapuntal pieces . 

They were originally written as musical exercises for his students . 

Bach titled the collection : Forthright instruction , wherewith lovers of the clavier , especially those desirous of learning , are shown in a clear way not only 1 ) to learn to play two voices clearly , but also after further progress 2 ) to deal correctly and well with three obbligato parts , moreover at the same time to obtain not only good ideas , but also to carry them out well , but most of all to achieve a cantabile style of playing , and thereby to acquire a strong foretaste of composition . 

The two groups of pieces are both arranged in order of ascending key , each group covering eight major and seven minor keys . 

The inventions were composed in Köthen ; the sinfonias , on the other hand , were probably not finished until the beginning of the Leipzig period .
