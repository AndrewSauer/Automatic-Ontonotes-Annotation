A sponging - house was a place of temporary confinement for debtors in the United Kingdom . 

If a borrower defaulted on repaying a debt , their creditor would lay a complaint with the sheriff . 

The sheriff sent his bailiffs , or tipstaffs to arrest the debtor and take him to the local sponging - house . 

This was not a debtors ' prison , as such , but a private house , often the bailiff 's own home . 

The debtor would be held there temporarily in the hope that they could make some arrangement with the creditors . 

Anthony Trollope set out the system in his novel The Three Clerks of 1857 : 

If debtors could not sort matters out quickly , they were then taken before a court and transferred to a debtor 's prison . 

Sponging - houses had a terrible reputation , which was made clear in a description by Montagu Williams , a London lawyer who knew them well , in his Down East and Up West of 1892 : 

The idea of the sponging - house was based on that of the sponge that gave it its name , which readily gives up its contents on being squeezed . 

The sponging - house was the place where debtors had any available cash squeezed out of them , partly to the creditor 's benefit , but also to that of the bailiff who ran it . 

In French , “ éponger une dette ” ( sponge - up a debt ) means to repay one ’s debt .
