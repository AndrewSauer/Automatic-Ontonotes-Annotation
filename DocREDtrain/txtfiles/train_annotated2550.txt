The parks and gardens in Bratislava have formed a part of the landscape of the capital of Slovakia since the Middle Ages . 

Some of the historical gardens of Bratislava had such architectonic value that they were widely known outside of the city and well beyond the borders of the Kingdom of Hungary . 

Perhaps the best known garden in the city 's history was the renaissance Pálffy Garden , with its famous landmark , a centuries - old linden tree encased in a wooden terrace frame , seven floors in height . 

Today , Bratislava 's most famous park is Sad Janka Kráľa , established in 1774 - 1776 it is the oldest public park in Central Europe . 

There are over 20 different caretakers of parks in Bratislava and all of the parks and gardens in the city lack long - term and consistent care . 

The level of park maintenance is low and the parks often lack functioning pathways , benches and lightning .
