The Saint in Europe is a collection of short stories by Leslie Charteris , first published in 1953 by The Crime Club in the United States and in 1954 by Hodder and Stoughton in the United Kingdom . 

This was the 29th book to feature the adventures of Simon Templar , alias " The Saint " , and it also marked a resumption of the book series after a five - year hiatus . 

The publication of this book also marked the 25th anniversary of the character . 

The Saint in Europe marked the beginning of the " travelogue " era for The Saint . 

Continuing with the theme started by The Saint in New York , The Saint in Miami , and The Saint Goes West , the stories in this and the following two volumes take place in different exotic locales around the world . 

As such , it is the first Saint book since the 1938 short story collection The Happy Highwayman to not be primarily set in the United States . 

By this time , however , Templar 's British origins have been obscured and he is referred to as an American at least once .
