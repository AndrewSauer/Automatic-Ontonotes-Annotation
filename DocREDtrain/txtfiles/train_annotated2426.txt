Smith 's Bible Dictionary , originally named A Dictionary of the Bible , is a 19th - century Bible dictionary containing upwards of four thousand entries that became named after its editor , William Smith . 

Its popularity was such that condensed dictionaries appropriated the title , " Smith 's Bible Dictionary " . 

The original dictionary was published as a three - volume set in 1863 , in London and Boston , USA . 

This was followed by A Concise Dictionary of the Bible ( 1865 ) , intended for the general reader and students , and A Smaller Dictionary of the Bible ( 1866 ) , for use in schools . 

A Comprehensive Dictionary of the Bible ( 1868 ) , was published simultaneously in London and New York , and a four - volume Dictionary of the Bible ( 1871 ) , was published in Boston , amongst other things incorporating the appendices of the first edition into the main body of the text . 

In the UK , a corresponding second edition of the first volume in two parts , edited by Smith and J. M. Fuller , was published in 1893 . 

The original publications are now in the public domain ; some derivative , commercial versions are still in copyright . 

One of the contributors to the dictionary was George Edward Post ( of the American University of Beirut ( AUB ) ) .
