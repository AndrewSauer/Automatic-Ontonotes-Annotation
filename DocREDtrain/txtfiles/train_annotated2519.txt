La Bufadora is a marine geyser or blowhole located on the Punta Banda Peninsula in Baja California , Mexico . 

The spout of sea water is the result of air , trapped in a sea cave , exploding upwards . 

Air is forced into the cave by wave action and is released when the water recedes . 

This interaction not only creates the spout , but a thunderous noise as well . 

The phenomena repeats every minute or so with its volume depending on the strength of the waves . 

La Bufadora is one of the largest blowholes in North America , often shooting upwards more than above sea level . 

The exhibit hall roof top is approximately above sea level and the blowhole frequently sprays above it .
