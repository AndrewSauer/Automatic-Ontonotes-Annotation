Inner Harbour is a neighbourhood located in downtown Kingston , Ontario , Canada . 

The Inner Harbour district is bounded by Joseph Street to the north , Princess Street to the south , Division Street on the west and the Cataraqui River on the east . 

The area is within the King 's Town District . 

The District is represented on Kingston City Council by Councillor Rob Hutchison for the 2010 - 14 term of office . 

The average family income for the area is $ 45,715 which is lower than the city average . 

The Inner Harbour area consists primarily of working - class families with commercial activity focused primarily along Princess and Queen Streets on the south side of the neighbourhood . 

In the past the demographics of the Inner Harbour in addition to other north Kingston neighbourhoods contributed to local negativity toward living " north of Princess " . 

The term refers to areas located on the north side of Princess Street , which is the main east â€“ west thoroughfare through Kingston , and runs the length of the city as it is Highway 2 through town . 

In recent years the socio - demographic nature of this area has changed as increasing levels of gentrification and some studentification ( the social and environmental changes caused by increasing numbers of post - secondary students living in a particular urban area ) has taken place in some of these neighbourhoods . 

The areas proximity to downtown Kingston means it has many good examples of 19th century heritage buildings constructed of local limestone . 

It is also home to the newly built K - Rock Centre , a large venue entertainment and sporting arena . 

The La Salle Causeway which enters the Inner Harbour neighbourhood at the foot of Ontario Street is also the main link between Kingston and its eastern suburbs . 

It consists of three bridges , one of which is a lift bridge allowing boats access to the Cataraqui River , Inner Harbour and Rideau Canal system linking Kingston with Ottawa .
