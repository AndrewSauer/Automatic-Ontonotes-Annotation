Bartolomeo Passerotti ( 1529 â€“ 1592 ) was an Italian painter of the mannerist period , who worked mainly in his native Bologna . 

His family name is also spelled Passerotti or Passarotto . 

He traveled to Rome in the mid-16th century , where he worked under Girolamo Vignola and Taddeo Zuccari . 

Upon returning to Bologna , he accumulated a large studio , and influenced many Bolognese who would later play a role in the rise of the Baroque . 

Annibale Carracci ( whose brother Agostino studied with Passerotti ) was influenced by Passerotti 's genre scenes in a select set of paintings ( such as The Beaneater and The Butcher 's Shop , the latter being originally attributed to Passerotti ) . 

Lucio Massari and Francesco Brizzi were among his pupils . 

Four of Passerotti 's sons , including Ventura , Aurelio , Tiburzio and Passarotto were painters .
