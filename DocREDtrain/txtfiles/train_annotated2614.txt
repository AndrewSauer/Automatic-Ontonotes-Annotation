Return of Saturn is the fourth studio album by American rock band No Doubt , released on April 11 , 2000 by Trauma Records and Interscope Records . 

It marked the band 's first album as a quartet , following the departure of original keyboardist Eric Stefani in 1994 . 

After touring for two and a half years to promote their breakthrough third studio album , Tragic Kingdom , No Doubt wrote several dozen songs for its follow - up and eventually settled on working with producer Glen Ballard . 

Creating the album became a tumultuous process lasting two years , during which there was dissension among band members and between the band and its label . 

The album was completed after the band returned to the studio and recorded what became two of the album 's singles . 

The album maintains the ska punk and reggae influences of the band 's previous work , but with slower , more ballad - like songs . 

The lyrics to many of the songs describe singer Gwen Stefani 's pining for a more domestic life , contrasting that with her commitment to a music career . 

Upon release , Return of Saturn received favorable reviews from music critics , although several of them were divided over its different sound to its predecessor . 

It debuted at number two on the Billboard 200 but was unable to measure up to the sales of Tragic Kingdom . 

The album spawned four singles , only one of which charted on the Billboard Hot 100 . 

At the 43rd Grammy Awards , Return of Saturn was nominated for Best Rock Album .
