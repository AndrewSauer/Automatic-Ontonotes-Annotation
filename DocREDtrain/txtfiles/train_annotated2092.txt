The Coalition Avenir Québec ( CAQ ; , " Coalition for Quebec 's Future " ) is a centre - right Quebec nationalist and autonomist provincial political party in Quebec , Canada . 

It was founded by former Parti Québécois ( PQ ) cabinet minister François Legault and businessman Charles Sirois ; Legault also serves as the party leader . 

The party membership includes both Quebec nationalists and federalists . 

Legault has said it will never endorse a referendum on sovereignty , but more autonomy if necessary . 

Not long after its formation , the party gained nine sitting Members of the National Assembly of Quebec ( MNAs ) who had been elected as members of the PQ and of the Action démocratique du Québec ( ADQ ) ; the ADQ later merged with the CAQ in January 2012 . 

The party is registered with the Director - General of Elections in Quebec under the name Coalition Avenir Québec – L'équipe François Legault ( Coalition Avenir Quebec – Team François Legault ) . 

Members and supporters of the party are referred to as " caquistes " , derived from the French pronunciation of the party 's initials . 

However , the party had requested that the term " coalisés " be used instead . 

On 1 October 2018 the CAQ won a majority of seats in the National Assembly of Quebec .
