Simon Davies is a British privacy advocate and academic based in London UK . 

Davies was one of the first campaigners in the field of international privacy advocacy , founding the watchdog organization Privacy International in 1990 and subsequently working in emerging areas of privacy such as electronic visual surveillance , identity systems , border security , encryption policy and biometrics . 

In July 2008 Davies criticised the Stranton landmark Viacom vs. Google & YouTube ruling , stating the privacy of millions of YouTube users was threatened : ' The chickens have come home to roost for Google . 

Their arrogance and refusal to listen to friendly advice has resulted in the privacy of tens of millions being placed under threat . 

Governments and organisations are realising that companies like Google have a warehouse full of data . 

And while that data is stored it is under threat of being used and putting privacy in danger . ' 

Davies was also listed as current Chief Executive Officer of UK consultancy group 80/20 Thinking Limited , which is defunct as of June 2015 .
