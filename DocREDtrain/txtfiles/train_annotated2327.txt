The Fijnschilders ( literally " fine - painters " ) , also called the Leiden Fijnschilders ( ' Leidse Fijnschilders ' ) , were Dutch Golden Age painters who , from about 1630 to 1710 , strove to create as natural a reproduction of reality as possible in their meticulously executed , often small - scale works . 

Although in the seventeenth century , as in modern Dutch , the term fijnschilder was used to differentiate between a painter practicing classic techniques and one who , for instance , is a house painter , in the nineteenth century it became a label for artists like Gerrit Dou and his followers in Leiden . 

Dou , Frans van Mieris , Sr . and Adriaen van der Werff — all among the most successful of the Dutch Baroque — became identifiable by their " fine " manner , exquisite techniques , and extreme attention to detail resulting in works with smooth surfaces completely lacking painterly brush strokes . 

The application of paint contrasts with the textures and style of other Dutch painters , such as Frans Hals and Dou 's teacher Rembrandt van Rijn . 

In this way they have more in common with earlier traditions in Netherlandish painting , such as the detailed richness of Jan van Eyck . 

Other artists working in the style include Godfried Schalcken , Quirijn van Brekelenkam and , at times , Gabriel Metsu . 

The fijnschilders are best known for genre scenes showing everyday life and activities , candle - lit nocturnal subjects , and trompe l'oeil " niche " paintings .
