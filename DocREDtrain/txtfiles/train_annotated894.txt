Guy , Bishop of Amiens ( d.1075 ) was an eleventh - century churchman , in what is now the north - east of France . 

Although the genealogy of early Ponthieu and Boulogne is scanty ( and the 12th century versions unreliable , because of their efforts to tie the ruling houses of Boulogne and Ponthieu into earlier noble houses ) , it is most likely that Guy , the Bishop of Amiens , was the uncle ( and not the brother ) of Enguerrand II and his brother Guy I of Ponthieu . 

Count Enguerrand II 's and Guy I 's father Hugh II was the son of Enguerrand I by an earlier marriage : Enguerrand I evidently married a Boulognnais countess , the wife of Arnold II , who died in battle : from this later marriage came Guy and his brother Fulk ( later abbot of Forest l'Abbaye ) , and probably a Robert .
