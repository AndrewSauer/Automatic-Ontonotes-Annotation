Joseph II ( Joseph Benedikt Anton Michael Adam ; 13 March 1741 – 20 February 1790 ) was Holy Roman Emperor from August 1765 and sole ruler of the Habsburg lands from November 1780 until his death . 

He was the eldest son of Empress Maria Theresa and her husband , Emperor Francis I , and the brother of Marie Antoinette . 

He was thus the first ruler in the Austrian dominions of the House of Lorraine , styled Habsburg - Lorraine . 

Joseph was a proponent of enlightened absolutism ; however , his commitment to modernizing reforms subsequently engendered significant opposition , which resulted in failure to fully implement his programmes . 

He has been ranked , with Catherine the Great of Russia and Frederick the Great of Prussia , as one of the three great Enlightenment monarchs . 

His policies are now known as Josephinism . 

He died with no sons and was succeeded by his younger brother , Leopold II .
