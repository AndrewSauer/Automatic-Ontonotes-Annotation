Corrientes International Airport ( ) , also known as Doctor Fernando Piragine Niveyro International Airport ( ) is an airport in Corrientes Province , Argentina , serving the city of Corrientes , built in 1961 while the terminal was completed in 1964 . 

A new terminal and a new control tower were constructed between 2009 and 2011 . 

The old buildings were demolished . 

It is also known as Aeropuerto de " Cambá Punta " . 

It is usual to fly from Corrientes and return to Resistencia because both airports are really close to each other . 

The same is true with Sauce Viejo Airport ( SFN – in Santa Fe City ) and General Justo José de Urquiza Airport ( PRA – in Paraná , Entre Ríos ) , which are apart . 

It has a passenger terminal . 

Alternative from Corrientes , it is Resistencia International Airport , in Resistencia , Chaco , which is to the west . 

Between April 2014 and October 2015 , Corrientes Airport was closed because of works at Runway 02/20 . 

Daily flight AR1782/82 was rescheduled to Resistencia International Airport . This was made using 737 - 800 instead of 737 - 700 during August of that year .
