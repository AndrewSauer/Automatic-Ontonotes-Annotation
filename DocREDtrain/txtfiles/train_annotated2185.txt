" Someday " is a song by American singer and songwriter Mariah Carey from her self - titled debut studio album ( 1990 ) . 

It is a dance - pop song with new jack swing influences . 

Prior to Carey signing a record contract , she and producer Ben Margulies had written and produced a four - track demo which included " Someday " . 

After signing a contract with Columbia Records , Carey began work on her debut album and she reached out to Ric Wake to ask if he would produce the song , to which he agreed . 

The composition of the demo recording was changed during the recording process , most notably replacing the horns with a guitar , which Carey disapproved of . 

" Someday " was released as the album 's third single on November 15 , 1990 , in the United Kingdom and was released the following month in the United States with multiple remixes . 

The song was a critical and commercial success , being described as an album highlight and becoming Carey 's third consecutive number - one single on the US Billboard Hot 100 . 

" Someday " was subsequently included on many of Carey 's compilation albums and greatest hits releases , including # 1 's ( 1998 ) , Greatest Hits ( 2001 ) , The Essential Mariah Carey ( 2011 ) and # 1 to Infinity ( 2015 ) .
