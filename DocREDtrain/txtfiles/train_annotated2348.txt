Việt Tân ( ) is a network of members inside Vietnam and around the world , that aims to establish democracy and reform Vietnam through peaceful and political means . 

The organization was founded on September 10 , 1982 with Vice - admiral Hoàng Cơ Minh elected as chairman , which operated underground for two decades . 

On September 19 , 2004 , then - chairman Nguyễn Kim publicly introduced Viet Tan as it is known today . 

Viet Tan 's activities are rooted in the promotion of non - violent political change in Vietnam . 

The organization is outlawed in Vietnam and the government of Vietnam considers it " a terrorist force " . 

The U.S. government , most notably former U.S. 

Ambassador Michael Michalak , rejected this view , while United Nations describes Viet Tan as " a peaceful organization advocating for democratic reform " .
