Notts County Ladies Football Club , now defunct , was a women 's football club based in Nottingham , England . 

Like the club 's male affiliate Notts County FC , they played their home games at Meadow Lane . 

Notts County Ladies were created in 2014 when Lincoln Ladies were controversially relocated from Lincoln to Nottingham and rebranded . 

The club were originally formed in Lincoln in 1995 and also spent a period known as Lincoln City Ladies while affiliated to Lincoln City . 

Sincil Bank and other smaller venues staged the club 's matches during their time in Lincoln . 

The club was named OOH Lincoln Ladies from 2008 until 2010 , due to sponsorship from Ray Trew 's OOH Media PLC . 

The club withdrew from the FA WSL 1 , the top tier in the English women 's football league system , two days before the start of the FA WSL Spring Series on 21 April 2017 .
