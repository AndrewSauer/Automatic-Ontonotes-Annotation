The High Commissioner from New Zealand to Fiji is New Zealand 's foremost diplomatic representative in the Republic of the Fiji Islands , and in charge of New Zealand 's diplomatic mission in Fiji . 

The High Commission is located in Suva , Fiji 's capital city . 

New Zealand first maintained a resident Head of Mission in Fiji since 1970 . 

The Ambassador to Fiji is concurrently accredited to Nauru and Tuvalu . 

As fellow members of the Commonwealth of Nations , diplomatic relations between New Zealand and Fiji are at governmental level , rather than between Heads of State . 

Thus , the countries exchange High Commissioners , rather than ambassadors . 

Between 1987 and 1997 , this was not the case ; after the Coups of 1987 , Fiji was expelled from the Commonwealth , but rejoined after the promulgation of a new constitution in 1997 . 

Hence , from 1987 until 1997 , New Zealand was represented in Fiji by an ambassador .
