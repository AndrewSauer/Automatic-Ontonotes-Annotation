The Ingeniero Ballester Dam is a dam on the Neuquén River , in the Argentine Patagonia . 

The top of the dam doubles as a road bridge . 

The dam is located near the town of Barda del Medio , province of Río Negro , downstream from the El Chañar Dam ( the last part of the Cerros Colorados Complex ) , and from north - northeast from the city of Neuquén . 

Completed in 1916 , the dam is used to re - route part of the flow of the Neuquén River to a long irrigation canal which flows east and then southeast passing by the cities of Barda del Medio , Cinco Saltos , Cipolletti , Allen , General Roca , Ingeniero Luis A. Huergo , and Villa Regina , and then emptying into the flood plain of the Río Negro . 

A second derivation dam , downstream on the canal , sends water to feed the reservoir of the Pellegrini Lake . 

The Ballester Bridge over the dam is long and wide . 

National Route 151 crosses over it from Río Negro to the province of Neuquén .
