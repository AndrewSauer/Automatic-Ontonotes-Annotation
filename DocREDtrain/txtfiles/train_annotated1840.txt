Operation Mobile ( ) was the name given to Canadian Forces activities in the 2011 military intervention in Libya . 

The United States ' counterpart to this was Operation Odyssey Dawn , the French counterpart was Op√©ration Harmattan and the British counterpart was Operation Ellamy . 

The no - fly zone was proposed during the Libyan Civil War to prevent government forces loyal to Muammar Gaddafi from carrying out air attacks on anti - Gaddafi forces and civilians . 

The demonstrations in Libya were part of the larger Arab Spring movement that began in the country of Tunisia on 18 December 2010 . 

When demonstrations began in Libya , the government of Muammar Gaddafi responded with systematic attacks by air and ground forces , and repression of the protesters . 

In a speech , Gaddafi promised to chase down the protesters and cleanse the country " house by house " . 

Several countries prepared to take immediate military action at a conference in Paris on 19 March . 

The no - fly zone was enforced by NATO 's Operation Unified Protector . 

NATO took sole command of all operations in Libya from 06:00 GMT on 31 March , which effectively ended the U.S. Operation Odyssey Dawn , as all U.S. operations were absorbed into NATO 's Unified Protector . 

The Canadian contribution continued to fall under Operation Mobile , which ceased activities on 1 November 2011 .
