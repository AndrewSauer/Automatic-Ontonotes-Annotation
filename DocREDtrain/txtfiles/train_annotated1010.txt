An ice giant is a giant planet composed mainly of elements heavier than hydrogen and helium , such as oxygen , carbon , nitrogen , and sulfur . 

There are two known ice giants in the Solar System : Uranus and Neptune . 

In astrophysics and planetary science the term " ices " refers to volatile chemical compounds with freezing points above about 100   K , such as water , ammonia , or methane , with freezing points of 273   K , 195   K , and 91   K , respectively ( see Volatiles ) . 

In the 1990s , it was realized that Uranus and Neptune are a distinct class of giant planet , separate from the other giant planets , Jupiter and Saturn . 

They have become known as ice giants . 

Their constituent compounds were solids when they were primarily incorporated into the planets during their formation , either directly in the form of ices or trapped in water ice . 

Today , very little of the water in Uranus and Neptune remains in the form of ice . 

Instead , water primarily exists as supercritical fluid at the temperatures and pressures within them . 

Ice giants consist of only about 20 % hydrogen and helium in mass , as opposed to the Solar System 's gas giants , Jupiter and Saturn , which are both more than 90 % hydrogen and helium in mass .
