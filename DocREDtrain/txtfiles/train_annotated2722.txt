L'ultimo giorno di Pompei ( " The last day of Pompeii " ) is an opera ( dramma per musica ) in two acts composed by Giovanni Pacini to an Italian libretto by Andrea Leone Tottola . 

It premiered to great success at the Teatro San Carlo in Naples on 19 November 1825 followed by productions in the major opera houses of Italy , Austria , France , and Portugal . 

When Pacini 's popularity declined in the mid-19th century , the opera was all but forgotten until 1996 when it received its first performance in modern times at the Festival della Valle d'Itria in Martina Franca . 

L'ultimo giorno di Pompei influenced either directly or indirectly several other 19th - century works , most notably Karl Bryullov 's 1833 painting , The Last Day of Pompeii .
