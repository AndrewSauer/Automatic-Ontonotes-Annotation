Greatest Hits is the first greatest hits compilation album by American hard rock band Aerosmith , released by Columbia Records in October 1980 . 

It went multi - platinum and contained the songs that made the band an icon of the 1970s rock era . 

Some of the tracks were significantly edited from their original versions . 

The single version of " Same Old Song and Dance " was used , and was edited down almost a full minute . 

It also contained an alternate lyric which was n't heard on Get Your Wings . 

The original lyric was " Gotcha with the cocaine , found with your gun . " 

The alternate lyric , included on the compilation , was " You shady lookin ' loser , you played with my gun . " 

" Sweet Emotion " also used the single version ; it begins with the first chorus , cutting out the now famous talk box intro and the coda was replaced with a repeating chorus and fades out . 

" Kings and Queens " was also edited down , cutting the intro and certain other parts . 

" Walk This Way " was edited slightly , chanting the first chorus once instead of twice . 

The other remaining tracks were kept intact . 

In 1997 , a slightly revised version , Greatest Hits 1973â€“1988 , was released , with the ten tracks in their edited versions retained , with five additional songs from the same era added , plus the 1991 version of " Sweet Emotion " and a live version of " One Way Street " . 

Greatest Hits is the band 's highest RIAA certified album in the United States , having been certified 11x Platinum in 2007 .
