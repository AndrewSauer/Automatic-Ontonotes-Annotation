The General People 's Committee ( , al - lajna ash - sha'biyya al-'ƒÅmma ) , often abbreviated as the GPCO , was the executive branch of government during the era of the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya . 

It served as the intermediary between the masses and government leadership and was composed of a general secretary and twenty secretaries of some 600 local " basic popular congresses " ( BPC ) , GPCO members were elected by the country 's parliament , the General People 's Congress , and had no fixed terms . 

It was the rough equivalent of the cabinet in many republics , constitutional democracies , and constitutional monarchies , as well as the Executive Board of the rival National Transitional Council , which ultimately replaced the jamahiriya as Libya 's dominant force as a result of the Libyan Civil War . 

The GPCO was scattered by the fall of Tripoli in August , with some of its members fleeing into exile , some becoming prisoners of war , and some remaining in Libya .
