Mamil or MAMIL ( an acronym standing for " middle - aged man in lycra " ) is someone who rides an expensive racing bicycle for leisure , wearing endurance- and performance - enhancing body - hugging jerseys and shorts . 

The word was reportedly coined by British marketing research firm Mintel in 2010 . 

It gained further popularity in the United Kingdom with the success of Bradley Wiggins in the 2012 Tour de France and at the 2012 Summer Olympics , held in London . 

The UCI World Championships victory in recent years have also spurred interest . 

In Australia the popularity of this sort of cycling has been associated with the Tour Down Under and the 2011 Tour de France winner Cadel Evans . 

Former Prime Minister Tony Abbott has been described as a " mamil " . 

Buying an expensive road bicycle has been described as a more healthy and affordable response to a midlife crisis than buying an expensive sports car . 

There are documentaries investigating this cycling culture . 

MAMIL is the title of a one - man play by New Zealand playwright Greg Cooper , written for actor Mark Hadlow . 

It is also the title of a feature - length documentary directed by Nickolas Bird and produced by Bird , Eleanor Sharpe and Mark Bird .
