Pietro Caruso ( born 10 November 1899 in Maddaloni – died 22 September 1944 in Rome ) was an Italian Fascist and head of the Italian police during the final part of World War II . 

Together with Herbert Kappler , the German Gestapo chief in Rome , Caruso organised the massacre in Fosse Ardeatine on 24 March 1944 as revenge for an attack the day before by Italian partisans on a column of German soldiers in Rome . 

335   people , many of them belonging to a Communist military resistance group , were shot during the massacre . 

One of the victims , Maurizio Giglio , had been one of Caruso 's own lieutenants , but had been arrested seven days earlier as a secret agent working for the Allies through OSS . 

After Italy 's liberation from the German occupation , Caruso was tried for his numerous crimes , sentenced to death and executed by firing squad by the Carabinieri in the courtyard of the Fort Bravetta in Rome .
