Andrijano Dzeladin established the station in September 2012 , to end prejudice and to provide a link for the Romani people . 

Dzeladin , a Macedonian citizen , named the television station after Sutka , a suburb of Skopje , the capital of Macedonia . 

He said that the Roma have " a culture , an anthem , a flag and integrity " . 

He wants the Romani language to be spoken in all the programs broadcast from the television station . 

According to the report by France 24 , " most programs — culinary , cultural or musical — involve listeners . "
