Google Keep is a note - taking service developed by Google . 

Launched on March 20 , 2013 , Google Keep is available on the web , and has mobile apps for the Android and iOS mobile operating systems . 

Keep offers a variety of tools for taking notes , including text , lists , images , and audio . 

Users can set reminders , which are integrated with Google Now . 

Text from images can be extracted using optical character recognition , and voice recordings can be transcribed . 

The interface allows for a single - column view or a multi - column view . 

Notes can be color - coded , and labels can be applied for organization . 

Later updates have added functionality to pin notes , and to collaborate on notes with other Keep users in real - time . 

Google Keep has received mixed reviews . 

A review just after launch in 2013 praised its speed , the quality of voice notes , synchronization , and the widget that could be placed on the Android home screen . 

Reviews in 2016 have criticized the lack of formatting options , inability to undo changes , and an interface that only offers two view modes where neither was liked for their handling of long notes . 

However , Google Keep received praise for features including universal device access , native integration with other Google services , and the option to turn photos into text through optical character recognition .
