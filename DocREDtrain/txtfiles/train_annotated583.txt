Bolita ( Spanish for Little Ball ) , is a type of lottery which was popular in the latter 19th and early 20th centuries in Cuba and among Florida 's working class Hispanic , Italian , and black population . 

In the basic bolita game , 100 small numbered balls are placed into a bag and mixed thoroughly , and bets are taken on which number will be drawn . 

Many variations on this theme were created . 

Bets were typically very small and sometimes sold well in advance , and the game could be rigged , by having extra balls of a given number or not including others at all . 

Other means of cheating included having certain balls filled with lead so they would sink to the bottom of the bag , or putting certain balls in ice beforehand so they would be cold and therefore easy for the selector to find by touch . 

Over time , Hispanics developed a name for each number in a system called La Charada or Las Charadas , creating a superstitious method for interpreting game outcomes or placing bets , many times in accordance with one 's dreams the previous night . 

Today Bolita is played in Puerto Rico and , in the United States , among Cuban and Puerto Rican groups .
