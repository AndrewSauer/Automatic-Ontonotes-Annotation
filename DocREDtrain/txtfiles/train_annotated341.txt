Maier Zipser , Hungarian rabbi ; born at Balassagyarmat , 14 August 1815 ; died at Rechnitz , 10 December 1869 . 

He studied in various yeshibot , among his teachers being Wolf Boskowitz and Maier Eisenstadt ; and he acquired a secular education partly through the assistance of Löw Schwab and partly through his own endeavors . 

In 1844 he was chosen rabbi at Stuhlweissenburg , where , however , he became involved in a controversy with the Orthodox members of the community on account of a divorce which he had granted without a precedent . 

In his defense he wrote a pamphlet titled Me ha - Shiloaḥ : Rabbinisches Gutachten über Jüdische Ehescheidung ( Budapest , 1853 ) . 

About 1850 he went to England , where he published a pamphlet titled The Sermon on the Mount , defending Judaism against the parliamentary speeches of Inglis ( London , 1852 ) . 

In 1858 Zipser was elected rabbi of Rechnitz , and he held this position until his death . 

In addition to the two pamphlets already mentioned , he published various sermons and made numerous contributions to the Jewish press , especially to the Orient , the Allgemeine Zeitung des Judenthums , and the Neuzeit , winning the reputation of being one of the most scholarly Hungarian rabbis of his day .
