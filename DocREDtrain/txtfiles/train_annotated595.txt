" Savoy Truffle " is a song by the English rock group the Beatles from their 1968 album The Beatles ( also known as " the White Album " ) . 

The song was written by George Harrison and inspired by his friend Eric Clapton 's fondness for chocolate . 

The lyrics list the various flavours offered in Mackintosh 's Good News chocolates and serve as a warning to Clapton about the detrimental effect that his gorging would have on his teeth . 

Along with Clapton 's guest appearance on the White Album track " While My Guitar Gently Weeps " and Harrison reciprocating on Cream 's " Badge " , it is one of several songs that mark the start of a long - lasting musical association between the two guitarists . 

The Beatles recorded " Savoy Truffle " in October 1968 , towards the end of the five - month sessions for the album . 

An upbeat rock track in the soul genre , the song reflects Harrison 's return to the guitar as his main musical instrument after two years of studying the Indian sitar . 

The recording includes a Chris Thomas - arranged horn section , and introduced the horn - heavy sound that became a feature of Harrison 's music as a solo artist . 

Through the lyrics ' reference to " Ob - La - Di , Ob - La - Da " , the song is also an example of the Beatles ' use of self - quotation in their later work . 

On release , " Savoy Truffle " was viewed by many commentators as a sign of Harrison 's growing maturity as a songwriter . 

Among more recent assessments , Ian MacDonald cited it as an example of the lesser material found on The Beatles , while Daryl Easlea of BBC Music describes it as one of the " doodles that delight " and " a fine counterweight " to " While My Guitar Gently Weeps " . 

Ella Fitzgerald , Terry Manning and They Might Be Giants have also recorded the song .
