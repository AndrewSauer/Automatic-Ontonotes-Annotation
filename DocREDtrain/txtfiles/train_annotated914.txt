Balaclava railway station is located on the Sandringham line in Victoria , Australia . 

It serves the south - eastern Melbourne suburb of Balaclava opening on 19 December 1859 . 

It is an elevated station located above the Carlisle Street rail overpass . 

In 1981 the station buildings were reconstructed and was reconstructed again in 2013/14 as part of an upgrade to the station . 

In 1996 two men found $ 200,000 in a drum buried beneath one of the platforms . 

They handed it into the police and the find was reported in the media . 

In the same week another man found a second drum under the platform containing a similar quantity of money , which he also turned into the police . 

As no one claimed the money , both men were granted ownership of the money they found , despite being considered trespassers on land owned by the Public Transport Corporation .
