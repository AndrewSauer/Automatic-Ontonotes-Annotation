The Belknap Stone House in Newburgh , New York , USA , was built by Abel Belknap in the 1750s . 

Located on Broadway ( New York State Route 17 K ) near the city 's western boundary , it is the second oldest structure in the city after Hasbrouck House , Washington 's headquarters during the last years of the American Revolutionary War . 

Belknap chaired the local Committee of Safety during the war , and when the Continental Army was encamped in the Newburgh area in 1782 - 83 , the house served as James Clinton 's headquarters in the area . 

Today it has been restored and houses some local law offices and other businesses . 

It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2001 .
