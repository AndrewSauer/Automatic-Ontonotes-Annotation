Nimbin is a village in the Northern Rivers area of the Australian state of New South Wales , approximately north of Lismore , northeast of Kyogle , and west of Byron Bay . 

Nimbin is notable for the prominence of its environmental initiatives such as permaculture , sustainability , and self - sufficiency , as well as the cannabis counterculture . 

Writer Austin Pick described his initial impressions of the village this way : " It is as if a smoky avenue of Amsterdam has been placed in the middle of the mountains behind frontier - style building facades . 

... Nimbin is a strange place indeed . " 

Nimbin has been described in literature and mainstream media as ' the drug capital of Australia ' , ' a social experiment ' , and ' an escapist sub - culture ' . 

Nimbin has become an icon in Australian cultural history , with many of the values first introduced there by the counterculture becoming part of modern Australian culture .
