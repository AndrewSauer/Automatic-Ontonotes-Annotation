Speech is the fourth ( and final ) album of the British blues - rock band Steamhammer . 

In 1971 , bassist Steve Davy left the band , and Louis Cennamo was recruited as his replacement - then , vocalist / guitarist Kieran White also left the band after a summer tour . 

Guitarist Martin Pugh , drummer Mick Bradley and Cennamo ( with guest vocalist Garth Watt - Roy , of Fuzzy Duck ) then went in the studio to record Speech , which was released in 1972 . 

It consisted of three lengthy ( and mostly instrumental ) songs in a heavier progressive - rock vein , that was somewhat different from their initial blues and folk / jazz - influenced albums . 

Bradley died from leukemia shortly before the album 's mixing was completed ( the album is dedicated to him on the inside album cover ) . 

The band continued with American singer / guitarist Bruce Payne and drummer John Lingwood , touring in Germany in support of the album , where they were more popular than back home in England . 

After Steamhammer wound down , Pugh and Cennamo joined up with former Yardbirds vocalist Keith Relf ( who had provided production assistance on Speech , as well as contributing background vocals ) and drummer Bobby Caldwell , formerly of Johnny Winter 's band and Captain Beyond , to form Armageddon .
