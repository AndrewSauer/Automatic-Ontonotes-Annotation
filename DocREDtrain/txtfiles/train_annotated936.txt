Mary Tudor (; 18 March 1496 â€“ 25 June 1533 ) was an English princess who was briefly Queen of France and later progenitor of a family that claimed the English throne . 

The younger surviving daughter of Henry VII , King of England and Elizabeth of York , Mary became the third wife of Louis XII of France , more than 30 years her senior . 

Following his death , she married Charles Brandon , 1st Duke of Suffolk . 

The marriage , which was performed secretly in France , took place during the reign of her brother Henry VIII and without his consent . 

This necessitated the intervention of Thomas Wolsey , and although Henry eventually pardoned the couple , they were forced to pay a large fine . 

Mary 's second marriage produced four children , and through her eldest daughter Frances , Mary was the maternal grandmother of Lady Jane Grey , who was the de facto monarch of England for nine days in July 1553 .
