The Bavarian Crown Jewels are a set of crown jewels created for the Kingdom of Bavaria , which existed from 1806 to 1918 . 

In 1806 , as part of his wholescale re - ordering of the map of Europe , Emperor Napol√©on I of the French upgraded the independent German duchy of Bavaria to full kingdom status . 

The former Duke of Bavaria , now King of Bavaria , Maximilian I , commemorated the fact by commissioning a set of crown jewels for use by Bavarian monarchs . 

However , there was no coronation ceremony , and the king never wore the crown in public . 

Rather , it was placed on a cushion when displayed on occasions such as the king 's ascension or his funeral . 

Included in the regalia were : 

The Crown of Bavaria - the King 's crown , which was set with rubies , diamonds , emeralds , sapphires and pearls ; 

the Crown of the Queens of Bavaria , which was made for the then queen , Karoline of Baden , and which contains huge pearls and large diamonds ; 

The 96 centimetre long State Sword ; 

The Royal Orb - made of gold ; 

The 89 centimetre long Royal Sceptre set with brilliants , emeralds and sapphires and the top is surmounted by a small round crown . 

The Palatinate Pearl is also kept with the crown jewels , however it is not officially part of the collection . 

As a result of the First World War , the German monarchies were abolished in 1918 and since then , Bavaria has not had a monarch . 

The Bavarian Crown Jewels are currently on display in the Treasury of the Residenz palace in Munich .
