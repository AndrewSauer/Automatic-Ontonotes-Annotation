Nabacalis is a community on the East Coast of Demerara , in the Demerara - Mahaica region . 

It is in low - lying country by the coast , which is subject to flooding in the rainy season . 

The community is served by the Dr. CC Nicholson Hospital , but as of 2012 it was not staffed with doctors around the clock . 

The hospital was established as a medical center in 1994 with funds from the London - based Cyril Charles Nicholson Foundation , and the government began to upgrade it in 2003 to give residents of Nabaclis and nearby communities an alternative to going into Georgetown for treatment . 

The artist Emerson Samuels was born and brought up here , studying at the Golden Grove Methodist School . 

Also born here was conductor Rudolph Dunbar .
