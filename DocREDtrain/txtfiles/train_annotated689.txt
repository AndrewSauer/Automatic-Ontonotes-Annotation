Not to be confused with Checkbook diplomacy . 

Dollar diplomacy of the United States — particularly during President William Howard Taft 's term— was a form of American foreign policy to further its aims in Latin America and East Asia through use of its economic power by guaranteeing loans made to foreign countries . 

Historian Thomas A. Bailey argues that dollar diplomacy was nothing new , as the use of diplomacy to promote commercial interest dates from the early years of the Republic . 

However , under Taft , the State Department was more active than ever in encouraging and supporting American bankers and industrialists in securing new opportunities abroad . 

Bailey finds that dollar diplomacy was designed to make both people in foreign lands and the American investors prosper . 

The term was originally coined by previous President Theodore Roosevelt , who did not want to intervene between Taft and Taft 's secretary of state . 

The concept is relevant to both Liberia , where American loans were given in 1913 , and Latin America . 

Latin Americans tend to use the term " dollar diplomacy " disparagingly to show their disapproval of the role that the U.S. government and U.S. corporations have played in using economic , diplomatic and military power to open up foreign markets ,
