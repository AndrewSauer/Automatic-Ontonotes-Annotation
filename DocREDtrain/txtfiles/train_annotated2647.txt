George Smits ( Antwerp , 1944 â€“ 1997 ) , aka ' Toet ' , was a Belgian visual artist , experimental musician and inventor of experimental musical instruments . 

In the sixties , he was a member of the band of Ferre Grignard . 

Smits was also active as an actor in a few movies , and was part of Antwerp 's underground arts scene ( e.g. 

the Ercola collective and also part of Fred Bervoets band and Panamarenko ) . 

Besides his musical career , he was active as a painter , and an experimental musician with his own radio show on the Belgian public radio Radio Centraal . 

This radio show , broadcast at night , gave Smits the motivation to increasingly focus on creating music ( leaving some of his paintings unfinished ) , using instruments he had invented himself as well as effects , but also , gradually , new electronic tools . 

Smith prepared his radio show very precisely , spending about 20 hours recording sounds in advance of the broadcast . 

On his program , he used the pseudonym Captain Zbolk . 

George Smits is mostly known for his self - created musical instruments . 

Many of Smits ' instruments are acoustic and made with polystyrene , large springs and long strings .
