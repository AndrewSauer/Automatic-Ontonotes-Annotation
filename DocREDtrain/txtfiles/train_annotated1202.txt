Maksim Valerevich Zyuzyakin ( Russian : Максим Валерьевич Зюзякин ) ( born 13 January 1991 ) is a Russian professional ice hockey player who is currently under contract to HC Sarov in the Supreme Hockey League ( VHL ) . 

He has played for various KHL , Supreme Hockey League ( VHL ) , and Junior Hockey League ( MHL ) teams . 

Zyuzyakin was the only rostered member of the team not aboard the Lokomotiv Yaroslavl plane crash . 

He had been asked by head coach Brad McCrimmon to stay behind in Yaroslavl to rest and meet with the team in Moscow for their next scheduled game against Spartak , which was never played , as Lokomotiv Yaroslavl cancelled their participation in the 2011–12 KHL season as a result of the crash . 

Instead Russian hockey coach Petr Vorobiev led the team as it played part of the 2011 – 2012 season in the VHL , Russia 's equivalent of the American Hockey League . 

As the only surviving player , Zyuzyakin later was named captain of Lokomotiv Yaroslavl for the 2011 – 12 VHL season and became a symbol of the team 's revival . 

In the 2013 – 14 VHL season he went to the playoffs with Rubin Tyumen . 

He played with Metallurg Novokuznetsk for part of the 2013 – 14 KHL season .
