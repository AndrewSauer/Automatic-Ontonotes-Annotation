Gottlob Honold ( 26 August 1876 â€“ 17 March 1923 ) was the leading engineer in the workshop of Robert Bosch and , with Bosch , was the inventor of the spark plug and the modern internal combustion engine , as well as headlights . 

The combination of the Bosch spark plug and the high voltage magneto , a process patented on 7 January 1902 , made it possible for the gasoline - powered engine to become the standard for motor vehicles . 

Honold was born on 26 August 1876 in Langenau , in Germany , about 10 miles northeast of Ulm . 

Honold 's father was a friend of the father of Robert Bosch , and in 1891 , Honold first worked in Bosch 's Stuttgart workshop at the age of 14 . 

Following graduation from the Ulm gymnasium , Honold studied engineering at the Stuttgart technical university . 

In 1901 , Honold accepted an offer to become the technical manager of Bosch 's company , and worked on the task of developing an improved ignition system for combustion engines . 

The Daimler company ordered the Bosch engine and was soon breaking automotive speed records . 

Honold continued work on faster and more powerful engines . 

In 1913 , Honold helped develop the automotive headlights that are used today . 

Although lights had been used to some extent for night driving , the early lanterns did little more than to draw attention to a vehicle , and were of little use for illumination . 

It was Honold who conceived the idea of placing curved mirrors behind the lamp to increase the amount of light without taxing the automotive electrical system . 

Honold also helped develop the Bosch car horn . 

Honold died in Stuttgart on 17 March 1923 .
