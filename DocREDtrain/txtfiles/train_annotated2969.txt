Stair Dismount ( also known as Porrasturvat ) is a computer game originally made by Jetro Lauha of tAAt . 

It is a puzzle game where the goal is maximising the damage done to a 3D stickman figure ; the player causes damage by applying a force to the figure to make it fall down a staircase . 

The stick figure 's falls are accompanied by various sound effects — cracks , wails and groans — as it makes its way to the bottom . 

Stair Dismount uses ragdoll physics , so the figure is very floppy as it falls , like a ragdoll . 

The game was first published in Assembly 2002 , where it won the first prize in the game development competition . 

The newest version , 1.0.3 , is available for Microsoft Windows , Mac OS X and Linux . 

Stair Dismount for iPhone and iPod touch was released on 25 Nov , 2009 ( originally announced as Stair Dismount Touch ) . 

Later it has been modified to be an " Universal " build to add support for iPad . 

Subsequently it has also been released for Android devices in June 2011 .
