The United States Statutes at Large , commonly referred to as the Statutes at Large and abbreviated Stat . , are an official record of Acts of Congress and concurrent resolutions passed by the United States Congress . 

Each act and resolution of Congress is originally published as a slip law , which is classified as either public law ( abbreviated Pub . L. ) 

or private law ( Pvt . L. 

) , and designated and numbered accordingly . 

At the end of a Congressional session , the statutes enacted during that session are compiled into bound books , known as " session law " publications . 

The session law publication for U.S. Federal statutes is called the United States Statutes at Large . 

In that publication , the public laws and private laws are numbered and organised in chronological order . 

U.S. Federal statutes are published in a three - part process , consisting of slip laws , session laws ( Statutes at Large ) , and codification ( United States Code ) .
