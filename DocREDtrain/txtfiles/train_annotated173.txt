Nintendo Land features twelve different minigames , each based on an existing Nintendo game franchise such as Mario and The Legend of Zelda , depicted as attractions in the eponymous fictional amusement park . 

The minigames are designed to demonstrate the concept of Wii U and its Wii U GamePad controller to new players , in the same way the 2006 game Wii Sports demonstrated the Wii and its Wii Remote , utilizing many of the controller 's features , including its touchscreen controls and motion - sensing capabilities . 

Some minigames incorporate the Wii Remote Plus and Nunchuk controllers for alternate control schemes and multiplayer support , which also helps exhibit " asymmetric gameplay " , a concept in which certain players have different experiences based on the controller they use . 

Nintendo Land was mostly liked by critics , and sold 5.19 million copies as of December 2017 , making it the fifth highest - selling Wii U game . 

The ability to download the game was removed from the Nintendo eShop in North America on November 10 , 2013 , then returned for download on August 26 , 2016 .
