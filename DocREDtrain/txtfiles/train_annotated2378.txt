The Calais Conference was a 26 February 1917 meeting of politicians and generals from France and the United Kingdom . 

Ostensibly about railway logistics for the upcoming allied Spring offensive the majority of the conference was given over to a plan to bring British forces under overall French command . 

The British Prime Minister David Lloyd George was supportive of the proposal and arranged for the British war cabinet to approve it in advance of the conference , without the knowledge of senior British generals Douglas Haig and Sir William Robertson . 

The latter were surprised when the proposal was presented by French General Robert Nivelle at the conference . 

The next day the two generals met with Lloyd George and threatened their resignations rather than implement the proposal . 

This led to the significant watering - down of the plan with greater freedom given to British commanders . 

The conference caused mistrust between the British civil and military chiefs and set back the cause of a unified allied command until Spring 1918 , when the successful German Spring Offensive rendered it essential .
