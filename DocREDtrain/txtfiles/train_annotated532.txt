Australia â€“ Japan relations are foreign relations between Australia and Japan . 

The relationships are generally warm and have since continued to grown strong over the years , both nations being considerably close , substantial and driven by mutual interests , with both nations having close ties with the Western world . 

Japan is one of Australia 's major economic partners : it is Australia 's second " largest trading partner and an increasingly important source of capital investment " . 

In recent times the relations have expanded beyond strong economic and commercial links to other spheres , including culture , tourism , defense and scientific cooperation . 

There was some tension in the early stage of the relationship , such as World War II , whaling , and Japan 's perceived economic domination during the 1980s and early 1990s . 

However , the Australian government and business leaders see Japan as a vital export market and an essential element in Australia 's future growth and prosperity in the Asia - Pacific region . 

Japan on its part regards Australia as an important partner , a reliable source of energy , minerals and other primary products , a popular tourist destination , a useful conduit to the West and the only other middle - ranking economic power in the Asia - Pacific . 

Australia 's former Prime - Minister Tony Abbott recently hailed Japan as Australia 's closest friend in Asia , and planned on creating a Free Trade Agreement between the two nations in the coming year . 

Defence Minister Marise Payne described Japan as a " key partner " in the region , Japanese Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida describing the relationship as the linchpin of security in the Asia - Pacific .
