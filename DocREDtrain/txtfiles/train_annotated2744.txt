Moreton Island is a large sand island on the eastern side of Moreton Bay , on the coast of South East Queensland , Australia . 

Due to the island 's importance in navigating the northern passage into Moreton Bay and Brisbane , at least five lighthouses were constructed on the island , starting with Cape Moreton Light in 1857 , the first lighthouse in Queensland , and followed by at least four more lighthouses established from the 1860s , at Comboyuro Point , North Point , Cowan Cowan Point and Yellow Patch . 

Comboyuro Point Light , Cowan Cowan Point Light and Yellow Patch Light all had to be moved from their original location due to coastal erosion . 

Of the five lighthouses , only Cape Moreton Light survived and is still active today .
