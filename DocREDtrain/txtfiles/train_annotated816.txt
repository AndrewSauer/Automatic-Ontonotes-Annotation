The Domus Sanctae Marthae ( Latin for Saint Martha 's House ; in Italian , Casa Santa Marta ) is a building adjacent to St. Peter 's Basilica in Vatican City . 

Completed in 1996 , during the reign of Pope John Paul II , it is named after Saint Martha the hospitable , who was a sibling to Saints Mary and Lazarus of Bethany . 

The building functions as a guest house for clergy having business with the Holy See , and as the hotel residence of the members of the College of Cardinals when they are participating in a Papal Conclave to elect a new Pope . 

Pope Francis has made it his home since his election in March 2013 , declining to use the Papal apartments in the Apostolic Palace .
