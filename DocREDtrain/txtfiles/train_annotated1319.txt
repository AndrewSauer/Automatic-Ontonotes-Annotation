" Sentiments songes " ( " Liar feelings " , portmanteau between " sentiments " and " mensonges " ) was the French entry in the Eurovision Song Contest 1997 , performed in French by Fanny . 

The song was performed twenty - second on the night , following Denmark 's Kølig Kaj with " Stemmen i mit liv " and preceding Croatia 's E.N.I. 

with " Probudi me " . 

At the close of voting , it had received 95 points , placing 7th in a field of 25 . 

The song is a ballad , with Fanny explaining that we often run from love , instead of embracing it . 

She puts this down to fear of our true feelings . 

It was succeeded as French representative at the 1998 Contest by Marie Line with " Où aller " .
