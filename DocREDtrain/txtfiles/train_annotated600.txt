The Cabinet Mountains Wilderness , created by an act of Congress in 1964 , is located in the U.S. state of Montana . 

Protecting the wildest portions of the Cabinet Mountains and an integral part of Kootenai National Forest and Kaniksu National Forest , the wilderness had enjoyed more limited protection since 1935 as a Primitive Area . 

U.S. Wilderness Areas do not allow motorized or mechanized vehicles , including bicycles . 

Although camping and fishing are allowed with proper permit , no roads or buildings are constructed and there is also no logging or mining , in compliance with the 1964 Wilderness Act . 

Wilderness areas within National Forests and Bureau of Land Management areas also allow hunting in season . 

There are many mountain lakes and sky scraping peaks located in the Cabinets , the highest of the peaks being Snowshoe Peak .
