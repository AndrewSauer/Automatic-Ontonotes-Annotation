Gurdwara Darbar Sahib Kartarpur ( Punjabi , ) is a gurdwara in Kartarpur , Narowal District , Punjab , Pakistan , 120 Â  km from Lahore . 

It is built on the historic site where Guru Nanak settled and assembled a Sikh community after his missionary travels . 

The present gurdwara is built on the site where Guru Nanak died , on 22 September 1539 . 

The gurdwara is also notable for its location near the border between Pakistan and India . 

The shrine is visible from the Indian side of the border as Pakistani authorities generally trim the tall Elephant grass that would otherwise obstruct the view . 

Indian Sikhs gather in large numbers on bluffs to perform darshan , or sacred viewing of the site , from the Indian side of the border .
