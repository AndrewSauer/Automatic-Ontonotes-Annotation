The Central Idaho Dark Sky Reserve is a dark - sky preserve near the Sawtooth National Recreation Area , in the U.S. state of Idaho . 

It was designated on December 18 , 2017 and is the first gold - tier dark sky preserve in the United States . 

The area was designated by International Dark - Sky Association . 

The area includes the city of Ketchum , Idaho which was separately designated a " Dark Sky Community " in 2017 . 

Idaho State Highway 75 in the Sawtooth Valley between Redfish Lake and Pettit Lake roughly traverses the reserve 's " core areas " . 

Several sky quality meters are installed along State Highway 75 in this area . 

Local communities and federal authorities collaborated in the designation ; the governments will take measures such as shielding street lights to preserve the area 's dark sky ; Ketchum has had a dark sky ordinance since 1999 , and Sun Valley , also in the reserve , has its own local ordinance . 

The U.S. Forest Service , which manages much of the land in the area , will post informational signs about the dark sky reserve , and has said it will reduce light pollution from its buildings ; compliance by individuals on Forest Service land will be voluntary . 

Another dark sky certification effort was under way in 2017 about away at Bruneau Dunes State Park , which hosts a public astronomical observatory .
