" The Invisible Man " is a song by the British rock band Queen , written by drummer Roger Taylor but credited to Queen . 

The song is sung mostly by Freddie Mercury , with vocal contributions from Taylor . 

Originally released on the album The Miracle , it was released as a single in 1989 . 

Taylor claims that he got the inspiration to create the song while reading a book ( possibly the book of the same name ) , and the bassline instantly came to his imagination . 

This song marks the only time in any of Queen 's songs that all four band members names are mentioned in the lyrics . 

The first being Freddie Mercury , followed by John Deacon . 

Brian May 's name is then said twice ( just before his guitar solo starts ) , and while saying " Roger Taylor " , the first " r " is rolled to emulate the drums at the end of the verse . 

Freddie Mercury 's name is said by drummer Roger Taylor , and the other ones by the lead singer Freddie Mercury .
