Shankar Family & Friends ( stylised as Shankar Family Friends on the album cover ) is an album by Indian musician Ravi Shankar , recorded primarily in Los Angeles during the spring of 1973 , but not released until late 1974 . 

It was produced by Shankar 's friend George Harrison and one of the first releases on the ex - Beatle 's Dark Horse label . 

Out of print for many years , and much sought after as a result , the album was remastered in 2010 and reissued as part of the Ravi Shankar â€“ George Harrison box set Collaborations . 

The title Shankar Family & Friends refers to the group - participation approach to the music , from Shankar 's sister - in - law Lakshmi and son Shubho to a host of " friends " from the Indian subcontinent , Europe and the United States . 

In a deliberate blend of " East - meets - West " musical styles , other performers include Indian - music pioneers Alla Rakha , Ashish Khan , Shivkumar Sharma and Hariprasad Chaurasia , and Western musicians such as Tom Scott , Emil Richards , Billy Preston , Ringo Starr and Jim Keltner . 

The album features the Harrison - arranged pop bhajan " I Am Missing You " and a jazz - funk instrumental , " Dispute & Violence " , the latter a part of an intended ballet , titled Dream , Nightmare & Dawn .
