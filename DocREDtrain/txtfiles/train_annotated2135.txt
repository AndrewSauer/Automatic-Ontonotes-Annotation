The seven ill years was a period of national famine in Scotland in the 1690s . 

It resulted from an economic slump created by French protectionism and changes in the Scottish cattle trade , followed by four years of failed harvests ( 1695 , 1696 and 1698 – 99 ) . 

The result was severe famine and depopulation , particularly in the north . 

The famines of the 1690s were seen as particularly severe , partly because famine had become relatively rare in the second half of the seventeenth century , with only one year of dearth ( in 1674 ) . 

The shortages of the 1690s would be the last of their kind . 

During this period , starvation probably killed 5–15 per cent of the Scottish population , but in areas like Aberdeenshire death rates reached 25 per cent . 

The system of the Old Scottish Poor Law was overwhelmed by the scale of the crisis , although provision in the urban centres of the burghs was probably better than in the countryside . 

It led to migration between parishes and emigration to England , Europe , the Americas and particularly Ireland . 

The crisis resulted in the setting up of the Bank of Scotland and the Company of Scotland Trading to Africa and the Indies . 

The eventual failure of the Company in the Darién scheme increased the pressure for political union with England , which occurred in 1707 .
