Endurance : Shackleton 's Incredible Voyage is a bestselling book written by Alfred Lansing . 

It was first published in 1959 . 

The book recounts the failure of the Imperial Trans - Antarctic Expedition led by Sir Ernest Shackleton in its attempt to cross the Antarctic continent in 1914 and the subsequent struggle for survival endured by the twenty - eight man crew for almost two years . 

The book 's title refers to the ship Shackleton used for the expedition , the Endurance . 

The ship was beset and eventually crushed by ice floes in the Weddell Sea leaving the men stranded on the pack ice . 

All in all the crew drifted on the ice for just over a year . 

They were able to launch their boats and somehow managed to land them safely on Elephant Island . 

Shackleton then led a crew of five aboard the James Caird through the Drake Passage and miraculously reached South Georgia Island 650 nautical miles away . 

He then took two of those men on the first successful overland crossing of the island . 

Three months later he was finally able to rescue the remaining crew members they had left behind on Elephant Island . 

Virtually every diary kept during the expedition was made available to the author and almost all the surviving members at the time of writing submitted to lengthy interviews . 

The most significant contribution came from Dr. Alexander Macklin , one of the ship 's surgeons , who provided Lansing with many diaries , a detailed account of the perilous journey the crew made to Elephant Island , and months of advice .
