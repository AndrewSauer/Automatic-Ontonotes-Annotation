The Beijing Consensus ( also known as the China Model or Chinese Economic Model ) refers to the political and economic policies of the People 's Republic of China instituted after Mao Zedong 's death in 1976 by Deng Xiaoping . 

The policies are thought to have contributed to China 's eightfold growth in gross national product over two decades . 

The phrase " Beijing Consensus " was coined by Joshua Cooper Ramo to frame China 's economic development model as an alternative — especially for developing countries — to the Washington Consensus of market - friendly policies promoted by the IMF , World Bank , and U.S. Treasury . 

In 2016 , Ramo explained that the Beijing Consensus shows not that " every nation will follow China ’s development model , but that it legitimizes the notion of particularity as opposed to the universality of a Washington model " . 

Ramo has detailed it as a pragmatic policy that uses innovation and experimentation to achieve " equitable , peaceful high - quality growth " , and " defense of national borders and interests " , whereas other scholars have used it to refer to " stable , if repressive , politics and high - speed economic growth " . 

Others criticize its vagueness , claiming that there is " no consensus as to what it stands for " other than being an alternative to the neoliberal Washington Consensus , and that the term " is applied to anything that happens in Beijing , regardless of whether or not it has to do with a ' Chinese Model of Development , ' or even with the People 's Republic of China ( PRC ) per se " . 

This fluidity has been described as an " ultra - pragmatic " approach to policy .
