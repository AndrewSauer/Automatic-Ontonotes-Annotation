The saiga antelope ( , Saiga tatarica ) is a critically endangered antelope that originally inhabited a vast area of the Eurasian steppe zone from the foothills of the Carpathian Mountains and Caucasus into Dzungaria and Mongolia . 

They also lived in Beringian North America during the Pleistocene . 

Today , the dominant subspecies ( S. t. tatarica ) is only found in one location in Russia ( in the Republic of Kalmykia and Astrakhan Oblast ) and three areas in Kazakhstan ( the Ural , Ustiurt , and Betpak - Dala populations ) . 

A proportion of the Ustiurt population migrates south to Uzbekistan and occasionally Turkmenistan in winter . 

It is extinct in the People 's Republic of China and southwestern Mongolia . 

It was hunted extensively in Romania and Moldova until it became extinct in those regions at the end of the 18th century . 

The Mongolian subspecies ( S. t. mongolica ) is found only in western Mongolia .
