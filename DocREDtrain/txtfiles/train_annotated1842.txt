The SR West Country and Battle of Britain classes , collectively known as Light Pacifics or informally as Spam Cans , are air - smoothed 4 - 6 - 2 Pacific steam locomotives designed for the Southern Railway by its Chief Mechanical Engineer Oliver Bulleid . 

Incorporating a number of new developments in British steam locomotive technology , they were amongst the first British designs to use welding in the construction process , and to use steel fireboxes , which meant that components could be more easily constructed under wartime austerity and post - war economy . 

They were designed to be lighter in weight than their sister locomotives , the Merchant Navy class , to permit use on a wider variety of routes , including in the south - west of England and the Kent coast . 

They were a mixed - traffic design , being equally adept at hauling passenger and freight trains , and were used on all types of services , frequently far below their capabilities . 

A total of 110 Â  locomotives were constructed between 1945 and 1950 , named after West Country resorts or Royal Air Force ( RAF ) and other subjects associated with the Battle of Britain . 

Due to problems with some of the new features , such as the Bulleid chain - driven valve gear , sixty locomotives were rebuilt by British Railways during the late 1950s . 

This produced a design highly similar to the rebuilt Merchant Navy class . 

The classes operated until July 1967 , when the last steam locomotives on the Southern Region were withdrawn . 

Although most were scrapped , twenty locomotives found new homes on heritage railways in Britain .
