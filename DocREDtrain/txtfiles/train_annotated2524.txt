Westlake is a light rail and bus station that is part of the Downtown Seattle Transit Tunnel in Seattle , Washington . 

The station serves Pine Street between 3rd and 6th avenues in Downtown Seattle , near Westlake Center and Westlake Park . 

It is served by the Central Link , part of Sound Transit 's Link light rail system , as well as buses from King County Metro and Sound Transit Express . 

The station is also connected above ground by buses , the South Lake Union Streetcar , and the Seattle Center Monorail . 

Westlake station consists of two underground side platforms , connected to the surface by entrances and a mezzanine level served by nearby department stores . 

It is situated between University Street station to the south , and the former Convention Place station to the north ; Convention Place was only served by buses , however , and Capitol Hill station is the next northbound light rail station . 

The transit tunnel was built in the 1980s and opened for bus - only service on September 15 , 1990 . 

The tunnel was closed from 2005 to 2007 for a large renovation to prepare for light rail service , which began on July 18 , 2009 . 

Link light rail trains terminated at Westlake until the opening of the University Link Extension in 2016 . 

Trains and buses serve the station twenty hours a day on most days ; the headway between light rail trains is six minutes during peak periods , with less frequent service at other times . 

The tunnel will become train - only by 2019 , and a second downtown tunnel is planned to be built in 2030 , with a transfer at Westlake station .
