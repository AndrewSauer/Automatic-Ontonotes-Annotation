Thomas Simon ( c. 1623 â€“ 1665 ) , English medalist , was born , according to Vertue , in Yorkshire about 1623 . 

Simon studied engraving under Nicholas Briot , and about 1635 received a post in connection with the Royal Mint . 

In 1645 he was appointed by the parliament joint chief engraver along with Edward Wade , and , having executed the great seal of the Commonwealth and dies for the coinage , he was promoted to be chief engraver to the mint and seals . 

He produced several fine portrait medals of Oliver Cromwell , one of which is copied from a miniature by Samuel Cooper . 

After the Restoration Simon was appointed engraver of the king 's seals . 

On the occasion of his contest with the brothers John , Joseph and Philip Roettiers , who were employed by the mint in 1662 , Simon produced his celebrated crown of Charles II , on the margin of which he engraved a petition to the king . 

This is usually considered his masterpiece .
