The Latins were originally an Italic tribe in ancient central Italy from Latium . 

As Roman power and colonization spread Latin culture , Latins came to mean mostly unified Italic people and the Latin - speaking people of Dacia , Iberia , Illyria , and Gaul whose land was settled by Latin colonists ( see Latin peoples ) . 

The original Latins were an Italic tribe inhabiting central Italy , in present - day Lazio . 

Through the conquests of their most populous city - state , Rome , the Latins united all Italic tribes in to one group and then with " Romanization " or " Latinization " spread their influence across their empire . 

As the Roman Empire spread to include areas that are now Spain , Portugal , France , and Romania , these joined Italy in becoming " Latin " , as the languages spoken in these countries derive primarily from the Latin Language . 

In the late 15thâ€“16th centuries , a millennium after the fall of the Western Roman Empire , Portugal , Spain , and France began to create world empires . 

In consequence , by the mid-19th century , the former American colonies of these nations became known as Latin America and this region 's inhabitants as Latin Americans .
