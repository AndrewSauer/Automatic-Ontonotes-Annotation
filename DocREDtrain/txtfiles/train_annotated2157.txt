The globalization of baseball has been occurring since its inception . 

The early years saw an influx of players from western Europe . 

Major League Baseball eventually saw fewer European players , but more players from Latin America . 

Today Major League Baseball has players from five continents . 

The following is a list of countries and the first person born there that played Major League Baseball . 

These players are not necessarily the first citizen of each respective country to play in Major League Baseball as nationality is determined under a nation 's nationality law and may differ . 

Also , these players are classified strictly by the countries of their birth ; this does not reflect the following issues : 

Political change : A number of the countries listed here no longer exist , such as South Vietnam and West Germany ( respectively absorbed into Vietnam and reunified Germany ) . 

By contrast , the convention of the Hockey Hall of Fame , which is generally followed for purposes of nationality classification in ice hockey , is to classify players by the currently existing countries in which their birthplaces are located . 

Where players were trained in baseball : 

Some players on this list , despite their birth location , are or were Americans or Canadians who returned to their parents ' home country as children and were raised there . 

Most of the European - born players on this list moved to North America as children . 

For example , the first Netherlands - born player in MLB was John Houseman , who made his debut in 1894 , but it was not until 1979 that Win Remmerswaal became the first player born and raised in the European portion of the Netherlands to make his MLB debut . 

The case with Italy is similar ; the first player born and raised in the country to play in MLB was Alex Liddi in 2011â€”almost 80 years after the first Italian - born Major Leaguer made his debut .
