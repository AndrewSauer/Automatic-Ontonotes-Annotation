Arras Cathedral ( French : Cathédrale Notre - Dame - et - Saint - Vaast d'Arras ) is the Roman Catholic church in the city of Arras , France . 

The cathedral is the seat of the Bishops of Arras . 

The original cathedral of Arras , constructed between 1030 and 1396 , was one of the most beautiful Gothic structures in northern France , until it was destroyed in the French Revolution . 

The cathedral was the resting place of Louis de Bourbon , Légitimé de France , a legitimated son of Louis XIV and Louise de La Vallière . 

The church of the former St. Vaast 's Abbey was rebuilt in classical style as a replacement cathedral . 

The design was chosen by the former abbot of St. Vaast 's , the Cardinal de Rohan , and is of remarkable simplicity . 

It is ' a very large building , the erection of which was begun in 1755 from plans by Pierre Contant d'Ivry , the architect who later created designs for the Church of La Madeleine in Paris . 

The work was interrupted during the Revolution , then resumed by virtue of a municipal decree dated “ Nivôse 27 , Year XII ” , which ran : “ ... to erect the edifice , abandoning everything in the original plans connected with decoration and architectural beauty , limiting the work to the requirements of solidity and decency . ” The church was finished in accordance with these prescriptions , being completed in 1834 . 

The interior was of plaster - coated brickwork , whilst the columns were of undressed stone , covered with stone - coloured mortar . 

The capitals were of stucco - work . ' 

Arras Cathedral was heavily damaged by shelling in April 1917 , during the run - up to the Nivelle offensives of World War I , and subsequently rebuilt in its previous form . 

The cathedral is adjacent to the Musée des beaux - arts d'Arras , formerly the Benedictine Abbey of Saint - Vaast .
