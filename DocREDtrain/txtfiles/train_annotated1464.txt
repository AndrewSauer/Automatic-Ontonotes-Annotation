Jukkasjärvi ( ) is a locality situated in Kiruna Municipality , Norrbotten County , Sweden with 548 inhabitants in 2010 . 

It is situated at 321 meters elevation . 

The name is of Northern Sami origin , where Čohkkirasjávri means lake of assembly , as the area by the lake by which the village was founded was a Sami marketplace . 

The village got its first Finnish - speaking resident settlers in the 17th century , who changed the name into the more Finnish - sounding Jukkasjärvi , thereby removing its meaning , although järvi ( jávri in Sami ) still means lake in Finnish . 

This was also the name used by Swedish officials . 

The village is a popular tourist accommodation during the winter months , from December until April , and is best known for its annual ice hotel , a hotel literally made from ice . 

The wooden church is the oldest building in the village ( built around 1607/1608 ) and is well known for its wooden carved altar piece triptych by Bror Hjorth .
