" Paper Hearts " is the tenth episode of the fourth season of the American science fiction television series The X - Files . 

It premiered on the Fox network on December   15 ,   1996 . 

It was written by Vince Gilligan , directed by Rob Bowman , and featured guest appearances by Tom Noonan , Rebecca Toolan and Vanessa Morley . 

The episode is a " Monster - of - the - Week " story , unconnected to , but conversant with , the series ' wider mythology . 

" Paper Hearts " was viewed by 16.59   million people in its initial broadcast , and received positive reviews , with critics praising Noonan 's guest role . 

The show centers on FBI special agents Fox Mulder ( David Duchovny ) and Dana Scully ( Gillian Anderson ) , who work on cases linked to the paranormal , called X - Files . 

Mulder is a believer in the paranormal , and the skeptical Scully has been assigned to debunk his work . 

In this episode , Mulder and Scully find that a child killer ( Tom Noonan ) who Mulder had helped to apprehend several years earlier had claimed more victims than he had confessed to ; and in the resulting investigation , learn that the killer is now claiming to have killed Mulder 's sister Samantha . 

Gilligan came up with the concept for " Paper Hearts " when thinking about the series ' longest running storyline , the abduction of Samantha Mulder ; he came up with a story questioning whether Samantha had not been abducted by aliens , but was rather murdered by a child killer instead . 

" Paper Hearts " was written specifically with Tom Noonan in mind for the role of Roche , and was amongst the first television work the actor had done .
