Unite Against Fascism ( UAF ) is an anti - fascist pressure group in the United Kingdom , with support from politicians of the three largest political parties in the House of Commons , including the former Conservative Prime Minister David Cameron and Labour politician Tony Benn . 

It describes itself as a national campaign with the aim of alerting British society to a perceived threat of fascism and the far right — in particular the British National Party ( BNP)—gaining a foothold at local , national and European elections , arguing that " there is a real danger that the BNP could get a significant platform in elected institutions " . 

Its joint secretaries are Weyman Bennett and Sabby Dhalu , formerly of the National Assembly Against Racism ( NAAR ) . 

Its chair is Steve Hart of the union Unite and its assistant secretary is Jude Woodward of Socialist Action . 

Since 2013 , UAF has mainly operated through the brand Stand Up To Racism , which has many of the same officers as UAF : Bennett and Dhalu as joint secretaries , Diane Abbott as president and co - chairs Dave Ward of the Communication Workers ' Union and Talha Ahmad of the Muslim Council of Britain .
