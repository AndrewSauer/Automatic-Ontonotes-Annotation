Harry Gordon Lawrence ( 1901 – 1973 ) was a South African politician . 

Harry Lawrence was on the liberal wing of the United Party . 

He was the most senior of the MPs who broke away and founded the Progressive Party in 1959 . 

Lawrence served as a minister in the government of Jan Smuts before the National Party came to power in 1948 . 

He was Minister of Home Affairs 1939 – 43 and January – June 1948 , as well as Minister of Justice 1945-June 1948 . 

Lawrence had his spleen damaged when he was attacked by Nationalists at a political meeting during the Second World War . 

This injury caused Lawrence continuous pain , as he explained when he declined to be considered for the Progressive Party leadership in 1959 . 

He did , however , become the first party chairman of the PP . 

Lawrence , like all the Progressive MPs except Helen Suzman was not re - elected at the 1961 General Election . 

He did not return to Parliament but served as temporary Party leader after Jan Steytler resigned in December 1970 , until Colin Eglin was elected leader in February 1971 .
