The Multicultural History Society of Ontario ( MHSO ) is a not - for - profit educational institution and archives located in Toronto , Canada . 

Established in 1976 , the Multicultural History Society of Ontario collects , preserves , and makes available irreplaceable records of our histories of migration and ethnicity . 

It undertakes educational programming to increase appreciation of the importance of diversity to the development and ongoing vitality of the province . 

The MHSO envisions a cohesive society in which Ontarians have the tools to eradicate cliché , stereotyping , and prejudice from our places of learning , work , worship , and play . 

It sees a role for itself in helping the citizens of Ontario learn to live together in a pluralistic society , and it is working to develop and support an environment in which all peoples in the province can coexist on an equal basis . 

Through its efforts to preserve the records and promote the histories of migration and ethnicity , the Society strives to increase access to the products of our diverse heritage , heighten the attention paid to context and complexity in accounts of our past , and create a deeper understanding of the commonalities of our various historical experiences . 

The MHSO hopes to instill an appreciation of our ‘ shared histories’ in all Ontarians regardless of their backgrounds and advance the notion that diversity has made a profound contribution to the province ’s social and economic development .
