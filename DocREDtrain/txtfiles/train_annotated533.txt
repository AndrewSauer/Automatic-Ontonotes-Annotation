The Indian Institute of Planning and Management ( IIPM ) was an unaccredited institute headquartered in New Delhi , which previously had 18 branches across India . 

The Institute has been widely criticized for false advertisements and fraudulent practices . 

After several controversies , the school 's Honorary Dean Arindam Chaudhuri decided to shut down all campuses across India , except the one in Delhi . 

Founded in 1973 , the institute used to offer undergraduate , postgraduate and doctoral programmes in national economic planning and entrepreneurship , and international and fellowship programmes . 

Its executive education programmes include non - credit courses and visits to foreign business schools . 

IIPM is not accredited by UGC or All India Council for Technical Education ( AICTE ) , and is not affiliated with the public Indian Institutes of Management . 

IIPM has been involved in controversies about its advertising . 

The University Grants Commission ( UGC)a government organisation responsible for the standards of university education in Indiaand the All India Council for Technical Education ( AICTE ) have repeatedly issued public notices stating that they do not recognise IIPM , and that they deem its technical programmes invalid . 

IIPM has responded by stating that it does not issue degrees and that it is not a university . 

In September 2014 Delhi High Court censured IIPM for misleading students and restrained it from using words like MBA , BBA , management course , and b - school to describe the programs it offers . 

In July 2015 , IIPM announced that it will stop offering education programmes directly , and shut down all its campuses outside Delhi . 

It will operate only as a research and training institute in Delhi .
