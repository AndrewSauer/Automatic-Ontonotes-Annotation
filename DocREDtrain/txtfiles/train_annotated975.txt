Streeterville is a neighborhood in the Near North Side community area of Chicago , Illinois , United States , north of the Chicago River . 

It is bounded by the river on the south , the Magnificent Mile portion of Michigan Avenue on the west , and Lake Michigan on the north and east , according to most sources , although the City of Chicago only recognizes a small portion of this region as Streeterville . 

Thus , it can be described as the Magnificent Mile plus all land east of it . 

The majority of the land in this neighborhood is reclaimed sandbar . 

Named for George Streeter , the neighborhood contains a combination of hotels , restaurants , professional office centers , residential high rises , universities , medical facilities , and cultural venues . 

The area has undergone increased development in the early 21st century as numerous empty lots in Streeterville have been converted into commercial and residential properties , especially in the southern part of the neighborhood . 

The neighborhood had earlier experienced booms following World War I and World War II .
