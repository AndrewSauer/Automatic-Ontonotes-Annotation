The Bolivarian missions are a series of over thirty social programs implemented under the administration of former Venezuelan president Hugo Chávez and continued by Chávez 's successor , Nicolás Maduro . 

The programs focus on social justice , social welfare , anti - poverty , educational , and military recruiting . 

They draw their name from the historical South American hero , Simón Bolívar . 

Using increasing the oil prices of the early 2000s and funds not seen in Venezuela since the 1980s , Chávez created the " Bolivarian missions " in 2003 , which were initially short - term projects dedicated to alleviating the largest socioeconomic problems facing Venezuela at the time . 

After enjoying political success , Chavez made the missions his central priority for his administration , directly overseeing their operations and increasing funding during electoral campaigns . 

The most important missions created include Mission Robinson ( literacy ) , Mission Barrio Adentro ( free medical coverage ) , and Mission Mercal ( affordable food ) .
