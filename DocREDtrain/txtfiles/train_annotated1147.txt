Hugh Raymond McCrae ( 4 October 1876 â€“ 17 February 1958 ) was an Australian writer . 

McCrae was born in Melbourne , the son of the Australian author George Gordon McCrae . 

Originally he trained as an architect , but later took up writing and acting , settling eventually in Sydney and later in the New South Wales town of Camden . 

His works are notable for a sense of lightness and delicacy , and he had produced , in addition to a volume of memoirs , a considerable body of verse , and a light operetta , an edition of his grandmother 's journal , and a volume of prose pieces . 

McCrae starred as Australian poet Adam Lindsay Gordon in W. J. Lincoln 's 1916 feature film The Life 's Romance of Adam Lindsay Gordon , shot in and around Melbourne . 

He wrote a fantasy play The Ship of Heaven which was produced by the Independent Theatre in 1933 , for which Alfred Hill composed and conducted the music . 

McCrae was well known to a number of distinguished figures in Australian artistic and literary circles . 

He is remembered for his friendships with Norman Lindsay and Kenneth Slessor , but he was also friendly with such figures as Christopher Brennan and Shaw Neilson . 

He shared an apartment with Pat Sullivan the creator of Felix the Cat in New York . 

' It comes properly as a postscript that in New York McCrae shared a flat with Pat Sullivan , the famed creator of " Felix the Cat . " 

When a film about Felix was being planned , Sullivan suggested that McCrae should do the drawings while he ( Sullivan ) supplied the ideas . 

McCrae refused and has regretted it ever since . ' 

In the 1920s , Australian - born composer John Gough ( 1903 - 51 ) set McCrae 's poem " Song of the Rain " ( from the collection Colombine ) to music .
