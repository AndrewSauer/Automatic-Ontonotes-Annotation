Simone Martini ( â€“ 1344 ) was an Italian painter born in Siena . 

He was a major figure in the development of early Italian painting and greatly influenced the development of the International Gothic style . 

It is thought that Martini was a pupil of Duccio di Buoninsegna , the leading Sienese painter of his time . 

According to late Renaissance art biographer Giorgio Vasari , Simone was instead a pupil of Giotto di Bondone , with whom he went to Rome to paint at the Old St. Peter 's Basilica , Giotto also executing a mosaic there . 

Martini 's brother - in - law was the artist Lippo Memmi . 

Very little documentation of Simone 's life survives , and many attributions are debated by art historians .
