Bedtime for Bonzo is a 1951 American comedy film directed by Fred de Cordova , starring Ronald Reagan , Diana Lynn , and Peggy as Bonzo . 

It revolves around the attempts of the central character , psychology professor Peter Boyd ( Reagan ) , to teach human morals to a chimpanzee , hoping to solve the " nature versus nurture " question . 

He hires a woman , Jane Linden ( Lynn ) , to pose as the chimp 's mother while he plays father to it , and uses 1950s - era child rearing techniques . 

This film is one of the most remembered of Reagan 's acting career and renewed his popularity as a movie star for a while . 

Reagan , however , never even watched the film until 1984 , when he had already served his first term as 40th President of the United States . 

A sequel was released called Bonzo Goes to College ( 1952 ) , but featured none of the three lead performers from the original . 

Peggy died in a zoo fire two weeks after the premiere of Bedtime for Bonzo ; another chimp was hired for the second film whose name really was " Bonzo " . 

Reagan did not want to work on the second film , as he thought the premise was silly .
