Trágala ( Spanish : " swallow it " ) is a song the Spanish liberals used to humiliate the absolutists after the military pronunciamiento of Rafael del Riego in Cabezas de San Juan , at the beginning of the period known as Trienio Liberal ( 1820 - 1823 ) . 

Particularly the satire is directed against Ferdinand VII , who in 1820 was forced to swear the Constitution of Cadiz when he pronounced his famous phrase " Let us march frankly , and I the first , by the constitutional path " . 

It is said that Rafael de Riego himself ordered , upon entering Madrid , for this composition to be spread . 

After the intervention of the powers of the Holy Alliance ( French expedition of the Hundred Thousand Sons of Saint Louis commanded by the Duke of Angoulême ) , it became a symbol of resistance against the political repression of the Ominous Decade . 

It is probably modelled after other songs of the French Revolution such as Ça Ira . 

This song , with different lyrics , continued to be sung in Spain as a leftist symbol against the right , the Catholic Church or the monarchy in different historical conjunctures , notably during the Second Republic and the Spanish Civil War . 

There were many versions of the anonymous and popular lyrics . 

La Pitita is counter song , sung by supporters of Ferdinand VII .
