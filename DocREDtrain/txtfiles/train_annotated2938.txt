Brigadier General Basilio Arturo Ignacio Lami Dozo ( 1 February 1929 – 1 February 2017 ) was a member of the Argentine Air Force . 

He participated in the military dictatorship known as the National Reorganisation Process ( 1976 – 1983 ) and , along with Leopoldo Fortunato Galtieri and Jorge Isaac Anaya , was a member of the Third Military Junta that ruled Argentina between 1981 and 1982 . 

Alongside Reynaldo Bignone and Omar Graffigna he was one of the last surviving members of the dictatorship . 

In the 1985 Trial of the Juntas he was charged with , and acquitted of , acts of torture , making false declarations , and kidnappings . 

In 1989 he was sentenced to an eight - year prison term in the criminal proceedings that arose from the 1982 Falklands War , in which he had served as commander - in - chief of the Air Force . 

In 1990 he received a presidential pardon from Carlos Menem and was allowed to keep his military rank . 

In 2003 the Spanish justice system sought his extradition in order to stand trial in Spain for crimes against humanity committed during the dictatorship . 

Initially the government of Spanish Prime Minister José María Aznar ruled the extradition inadmissible but , in 2005 , the Supreme Court overturned that decision and ordered extradition proceedings to go ahead .
