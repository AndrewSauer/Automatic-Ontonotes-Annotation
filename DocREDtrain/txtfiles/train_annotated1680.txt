Daan Forest Park or Da'an Park is a public park located near the centre of the Da'an District of Taipei , Taiwan . 

The park occupies twenty - six hectares and is bordered on its north , south , east and west by Xinyi Road , Heping Road , Jianguo Road and Xinsheng Road , respectively . 

The park is used by residents of Taipei as a green activity space and for various outdoor activities . 

The park was created in 1994 after the eviction of longtime squatters and the demolition of illegal buildings on municipal land , not by mayor Chen Shui - bian , as is often cited , but by his predecessor , Huang Ta - chou . 

Daan Forest Park was intended to play a similar role as other major city parks such as New York City 's Central Park and London 's Hyde Park , acting as the " lungs of Taipei city " and as respite for residents from the bustle of life in Taipei . 

Similar to the large parks of other cities , Daan Park is surrounded by high price luxury condominiums that fetch a premium due to their desirable views , some reaching the price of $ 400 million New Taiwan dollars ( approximately $ 14 million US dollars ) in 2012 .
