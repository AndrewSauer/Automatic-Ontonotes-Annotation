" On the Knocking at the Gate in Macbeth " is an essay in Shakespearean criticism by the English author Thomas De Quincey , first published in the October 1823 edition of The London Magazine . 

Though brief , less than 2000 words in length , it has been called " De Quincey 's finest single critical piece " and " one of the most penetrating critical footnotes in our literature " . 

Commentators who are dismissive of De Quincey 's literary criticism in general make an exception for his essay on Macbeth . 

The essay concerns Act II , scene three in The Tragedy of Macbeth , in which the murder of King Duncan by Macbeth and Lady Macbeth is succeeded by Macduff and Lennox knocking at the gate of the castle . 

The knocking ends Act II , scene 2 and opens II , 3 , the Porter scene . 

De Quincey wrote that for him , the knocking always had a pronounced effect : " it reflected back upon the murderer a peculiar awfulness and a depth of solemnity ... " De Quincey could not account rationally for this response , according to the then - accepted canons of literary criticism ; and he proceeded , through his essay , to venture a more psychological interpretation than had previously been applied to Shakespeare . 

The essay foreshadows the psychological approaches of much later criticism . 

De Quincey 's biographer Horace Ainsworth Eaton called the essay " penetrating and philosophic " , adding that De Quincey in this essay " produced conclusions as significant as anything in Coleridge or Hazlitt " . 

De Quincey also views his responses to the play in reference to another of his classic essays , " On Murder Considered as one of the Fine Arts " .
