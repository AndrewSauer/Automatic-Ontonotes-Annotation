Julio Nalundasan ( July 21 , 1894 â€“ 20 September 1935 , Batac , Ilocos Norte ) was a Filipino politician who was one of the political rivals of Ilocos Norte politician Mariano Marcos , father of Ferdinand Marcos ( who later became the tenth President of the Philippines ) . 

Nalundasan was killed by a sniper at his home in 1935 , the day after beating Marcos for the second time in elections for the office of representative for the second district of Ilocos Norte . 

Mariano Marcos ' son , Ferdinand , and brother - in - law , Quirino Lizardo , were later convicted for the murder . 

However , the conviction was overturned by the Supreme Court of the Philippines , through a decision by Associate Justice Jose P. Laurel ( who , like Marcos , also became President ) .
