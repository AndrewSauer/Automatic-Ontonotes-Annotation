Music for a Blue Train is a 48-minute 2003 documentary about busker musicians in the Montreal Metro subway train system . 

It was written and directed by Mila Aung - Thwin of EyeSteelFilm and produced by Germaine Ying Gee Wong for the National Film Board of Canada . 

A harmonica player known as Bad News Brown ( real name Paul Frappier ) acts as an impromptu host in the documentary bringing the viewers snippets of the lives of musicians in Montreal 's subway system – The Metro – run by Société de transport de Montréal ( STM ) that gives around 60 spots on a first - come , first - served basis , provided the musician - busker registers his name early enough as soon as the Metro opens to the public and returns during his assigned time to perform for an hour or two , amidst indifference from most passersby or , at times , a token word of encouragement .
