Barlonyo ( also Bar Lonyo , meaning " field of wealth " in Luo ) is a village in northern Uganda near Lira town , where a number of internally displaced people ( IDPs ) from parts of northern Uganda lived , as a result of a 20-year LRA insurgency . 

It is located in Orit Parish , at the North -eastern end of Ogur sub - county in Lira District . 

It is a 45-minute drive from Lira town . 

Ironically it is now a field of graves , making it a tourist attraction site . 

What catches the eyes is the v - shaped 70 meter long grave on which residents of Barlonyo will be seated on it , eating or washing their clothes - or even drinking potent gin . 

At the center of this conflict is the Lord 's Resistance Army ( LRA ) led by Joseph Kony . 

The Lord 's Resistance Army ( LRA ) , is a rebel group that had bases in Acholi sub Region of northern Uganda . 

It was formed in 1987 . 

The rebels have been accused of many atrocities in the area , including kidnapping children to train as soldiers or use as sex slaves . 

The Ugandan government blamed the LRA for a massacre of over 200 civilians at the IDP camp in Barlonyo on February 21 , 2004 . 

Unofficial reports indicate that somewhere between 300 and 500 people were either massacred or went missing that day ( according to locals , the government has allegedly tried to abbreviate the toll ) . 

The camp has since been disbanded by the government . 

Plans are in high gear to open a polytechnic school in the area in memory of the killings .
