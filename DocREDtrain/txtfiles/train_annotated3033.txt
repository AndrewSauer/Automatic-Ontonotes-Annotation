The Roman Catholic Metropolitan Archdiocese of Nanking ( ) is an ecclesiastical territory or diocese of the Roman Catholic Church in China . 

It was erected as the Apostolic Vicariate of Nanking in 1659 by Pope Alexander VII , and promoted to a diocese by Pope Alexander VIII on April 10 , 1690 . 

However , the diocese was demoted to the Apostolic Vicariate of Kiangnan on January 21 , 1856 by Pope Pius IX , and its name was later changed to the Apostolic Vicariate of Kiangsu on August 8 , 1921 and to the Vicariate Apostolic of Nanking on May 1 , 1922 . 

Pope Pius XII elevated it on April 11 , 1946 to the rank of a metropolitan archdiocese , with the suffragan sees of Haimen , Shanghai , Suzhou , and Xuzhou . 

The archdiocese 's motherchurch and thus seat of its archbishop is the Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception also known as the Shigu Road church . 

There were a number of years without a bishop after the death of Paul Cardinal YÃ¼ Pin on August 16 , 1978 , because of the irregular relations between the Communist government and the Holy See . 

On January 6 , 2000 , Francis Xavier Lu Xinping was ordained the new bishop of Nanjing along with four others in an illicit ceremony in Beijing 's South Cathedral . 

Since then he has been reconciled to the Holy See .
