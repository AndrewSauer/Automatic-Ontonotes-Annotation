The Canadian Screen Award for Best First Feature , formerly the Claude Jutra Award , is a special Canadian film award , presented by the Academy of Canadian Cinema and Television to the year 's best feature film by a first - time film director . 

The award was previously named in memory of Claude Jutra , a Canadian film director who died in 1986 . 

Formerly part of the Genie Awards ceremonies , the Claude Jutra Award was transitioned to be part of the Canadian Screen Awards . 

Following the February 2016 publication of Yves Lever 's biography of Jutra , containing allegations that Jutra had sexually abused underage children during his lifetime , the Academy announced that it was renaming the award to its current name . 

Québec Cinéma also removed Jutra 's name from its Prix Jutra ceremonies on the same day . 

The award is a juried prize whose winner is announced in advance , although the prize is formally presented to the winner at the ceremony . 

To date three films , The Confessional ( Le Confessionnal ) , and Away from Her , have won both the Best First Feature and Best Picture awards in the same year ; all three films ' directors also won the award for Best Director for the same films .
