Howell Works ( later the Howell Works Company ) was a bog iron - based production facility for pig iron which was established in New Jersey in the early 19th century by American engineer and philanthropist James P. Allaire . 

It is notable as one of the earliest American examples of a company town . 

Allaire purchased the Howell Works property to provide pig iron for his Allaire Iron Works in New York , which was at the time a leading manufacturer of marine steam engines . 

The Howell Works also manufactured its own lines of cast iron products . 

Allaire eventually transformed the Howell Works into an almost completely self - sufficient community , with its own housing and food supply for the workforce , its own post office , church , school and company store , even its own currency . 

After bog iron was made redundant by the increasing availability of iron ore , Allaire closed the Howell Works and eventually retired there with his family . 

The property remained in private hands until being bequeathed to the state in 1941 . 

Today , the Howell Works is a registered historic site known as Allaire Village .
