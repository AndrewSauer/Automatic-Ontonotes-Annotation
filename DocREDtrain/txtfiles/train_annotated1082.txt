The Peter Guice Memorial Bridge consists of dual two - lane automobile bridges carrying I-26/US Â  74 across the Green River , located between East Flat Rock and Saluda , in Henderson County , North Carolina . 

Surpassed only by the Phil G. McDonald Bridge in West Virginia and the Emlenton Bridge in Pennsylvania , it is the third - highest bridge carrying an Interstate Highway in the eastern United States at tall . 

Each bridge is long and wide , with two travel lanes and shoulders . 

In 1993 , both bridges were rehabilitated after missing welds and poor welds were found in the structures . 

As of July 2018 , both bridges are rated structurally deficient and functionally obsolete in the National Bridge Inventory . 

A major rehabilitation project for the bridges is scheduled to begin in 2019 . 

The bridge is dedicated to the memory of Peter Guice , who built the first toll bridge over the Green River in 1820 ; it replaced a hazardous ford along Howard Gap Road . 

An unrecorded flood washed out the toll bridge , but was replaced by his son ; the second toll bridge was destroyed by flood in 1916 . 

The current bridge is located high above where the former bridges once stood .
