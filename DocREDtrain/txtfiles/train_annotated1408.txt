Green Wing is an award - winning British sitcom set in the fictional East Hampton Hospital . 

It was created by the same team behind the sketch show Smack the Pony - Channel 4 commissioner Caroline Leddy and producer Victoria Pile - and stars Tamsin Greig , Stephen Mangan and Julian Rhind - Tutt . 

Although set in a hospital , it uses no medical storylines ; the action is produced by a series of soap opera - style twists and turns in the personal lives of the characters . 

They proceed through a series of often absurd sketch - like scenes , or by sequences where the film is slowed down or sped up , often emphasising the body language of the characters . 

The show had eight writers . 

Two series were made by the Talkback Thames production company for Channel 4 . 

The series ran between 3 September 2004 and 19 May 2006 . 

One episode , filmed with the second series , was shown as a 90-minute - long special on 4 January 2007 in the UK , but was shown earlier in Australia and Belgium on 29 December 2006 . 

Separate from the series , a sketch was made for Comic Relief and screened on 11 March 2005 . 

Another was performed live at The Secret Policeman 's Ball on 14 October 2006 .
