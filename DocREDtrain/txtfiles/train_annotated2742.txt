In the United Kingdom and Ireland , a retained firefighter , also known as an RDS Firefighter or on - call firefighter , is a firefighter who does not work full - time but is paid to spend long periods of time on call to respond to emergencies through the Retained Duty System . 

Many have full - time jobs outside of the fire service . 

Retained firefighters are employed and trained by the local fire and rescue service . 

When required to answer an emergency call , retained firefighters are summoned to the fire station by a radio pager ( also known as a " alerter " ) . 

Once at the station , the crews staff the fire engine and proceed to the incident . 

Retained firefighters are therefore required to live or work near to the fire station they serve . 

This allows them to respond to emergencies within acceptable and strict attendance time targets set out by each fire service . 

Typically , retained firefighters are employed in rural areas or in large villages or small towns . 

They provide cover to 90 % of the area of the UK - there are 14,000 in England and Wales . 

Of the approximately 8,500 operational firefighters in Scotland , about 32 % are retained . 

London Fire Brigade , West Midlands Fire Service and Guernsey Fire and Rescue Service are the only three fire and rescue services in the British Islands that do not have any retained firefighters . 

Unlike volunteer firefighters , retained firefighters are paid . 

They are paid an annual " retainer fee " for being on call and receive further pay for each emergency call they respond to . 

The Fire Brigades Union ( FBU ) and the Retained Firefighters ' Union ( RFU ) represent the interests of retained firefighters across the country .
