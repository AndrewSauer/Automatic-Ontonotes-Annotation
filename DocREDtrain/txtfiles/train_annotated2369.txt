The NetWare Core Protocol ( NCP ) is a network protocol used in some products from Novell , Inc. 

It is usually associated with the client - server operating system Novell NetWare which originally supported primarily MS - DOS client stations , but later support for other platforms such as Microsoft Windows , the classic Mac OS , Linux , Windows NT , Mac OS X , and various flavors of Unix was added . 

The NCP is used to access file , print , directory , clock synchronization , messaging , remote command execution and other network service functions . 

It originally took advantage of an easy network configuration and a little memory footprint of the IPX / SPX protocol stack . 

Since mid-1990s the TCP / IP implementation is available . 

Novell eDirectory uses NCP for synchronizing data changes between the servers in a directory service tree .
