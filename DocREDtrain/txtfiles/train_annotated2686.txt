The Gossler family ( also spelled Goßler , historically also Gosler ) , including the Berenberg - Gossler branch , is a Hanseatic and partially noble banking family from Hamburg . 

The family is descended from weavers and burghers in the city - republic of Hamburg , and rose to great prominence in Hamburg in the late 18th century as a result of Johann Hinrich Gossler 's marriage to Elisabeth Berenberg , the last member of the Belgian - origined Berenberg family and the sole heir to Berenberg Bank . 

Through marriage , the family thus became the main owners of the bank , which has legally been named Joh . 

Berenberg , Gossler & Co. since 1791 . 

Since the late 18th century the family has been widely regarded as one of the two most prominent Hanseatic families of Hamburg , alongside the closely related Amsinck family . 

A branch of the Gossler family was granted the name Berenberg - Gossler by the Hamburg Senate in 1880 and was later — controversially in the republic of Hamburg , which did not recognise the concept of nobility — conferred baronial rank by the Kingdom of Prussia . 

Several family members served as senators in Hamburg in the 19th and early 20th century , and Hermann Gossler was head of state in 1874 . 

Richard J. Evans describes the family as one of Hamburg 's " great business families . " 

The Gossler Islands in Antarctica are named in honour of the family .
