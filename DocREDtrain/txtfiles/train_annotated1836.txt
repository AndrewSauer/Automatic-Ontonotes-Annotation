John Kinzie ( December 3 , 1763 â€“ January 6 , 1828 ) was a fur trader from Quebec who first operated in Detroit and what became the Northwest Territory of the United States . 

A partner of William Burnett from Canada , about 1802 - 1803 Kinzie moved with his wife and child to Chicago , where they were among the first permanent European settlers . 

Kinzie Street ( 400N ) in Chicago is named for him . 

Their daughter Ellen Marion Kinzie , born in 1805 , was believed to be the first child of European descent born in the settlement . 

In 1812 Kinzie killed Jean La Lime , who worked as an interpreter at Fort Dearborn in Chicago . 

This was known as " the first murder in Chicago " . 

During the War of 1812 , when living in Detroit , Kinzie was accused of treason by the British and imprisoned on a ship for transport to Great Britain . 

After escaping , he returned to American territory , settling again in Chicago by 1816 . 

He lived there the rest of his years .
