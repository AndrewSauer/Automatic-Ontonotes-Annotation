The is a strait between Honshu and Hokkaido in northern Japan connecting the Sea of Japan with the Pacific Ocean . 

It was named after the western part of Aomori Prefecture . 

The Seikan Tunnel passes under it at its narrowest point 12.1 miles ( 19.5   km ) between Tappi Misaki on the Tsugaru Peninsula in Aomori Prefecture , Honshu , and Shirakami Misaki on the Matsumae Peninsula in Hokkaido . 

Japan 's territorial waters extend to three nautical miles ( 5.6   km ) into the strait instead of the usual twelve , reportedly to allow nuclear - armed United States Navy warships and submarines to transit the strait without violating Japan 's prohibition against nuclear weapons in its territory . 

The part of the Seikan Tunnel that passes under the strait is considered to be under Japanese sovereignty . 

The part of the Tsugaru Strait considered to be in international waters is still within Japan 's exclusive economic zone . 

The Tsugaru Strait has eastern and western necks , both approximately 20   km across with maximum depths of 200 m and 140 m respectively . 

In the past , the most common way for passengers and freight to cross the strait was by the Seikan ferry , approximately a four - hour journey . 

On September 26 , 1954 , 1,172 lives were lost when the ferry Tōya Maru sank in the strait . 

Thomas Blakiston , an English explorer and naturalist , noticed that animals in Hokkaido were related to northern Asian species , whereas those on Honshu to the south were related to those from southern Asia . 

The Tsugaru Strait was therefore established as a major zoogeographical boundary , and became known as Blakiston 's Line or the " Blakiston Line " .
