The Bridge River Country is a historic geographic region and mining district in the Interior of British Columbia , Canada , lying between the Fraser Canyon and the valley of the Lillooet River , south of the Chilcotin Plateau and north of the Lillooet Ranges . 

" The Bridge River " can mean the Bridge River Country as opposed to the Bridge River itself , and is considered to be part of the Lillooet Country , but has a distinct history and identity within the larger region . 

As Lillooet is sometimes considered to be the southwest limit of the Cariboo , some efforts were made to refer to the Bridge River as the " West Cariboo " but this never caught on . 

Though essentially consisting of the basin of the Bridge River and its tributaries , the Bridge River Country includes the communities of D'Arcy , McGillivray Falls , Seton Portage and Shalalth , which lie in the valley of Seton and Anderson Lakes and the Gates River just to the south , are also considered to be part of the Bridge River Country , and also simultaneously of the Lillooet Country . 

After the 1930s the term " Bridge River - Lillooet " came into currency as a result of the chosen masthead of the fledgling Bridge River - Lillooet News , which served the town and environs of Lillooet as well as the mining towns of the upper Bridge River .
