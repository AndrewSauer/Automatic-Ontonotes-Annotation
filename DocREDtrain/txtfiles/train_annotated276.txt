Jacques Feldbau was a French mathematician , born on 22 October 1914 in Strasbourg , of an Alsatian Jewish traditionalist family . 

He died on 22 April 1945 at the Ganacker Camp , annex of the concentration camp of Flossenb√ºrg in Germany . 

As a mathematician he worked on differential geometry and topology . 

He was the very first student of Charles Ehresmann . 

He is known as one of the founders of the theory of fiber bundles . 

He is the one who first proved that a fiber bundle over a simplex is trivializable and who used this to classify bundles over spheres . 

In a paper , written together with Ehresmann , he introduced the notion of an associated bundle and proved results known today as the exact homotopy sequence of a fibration .
