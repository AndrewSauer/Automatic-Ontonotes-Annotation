Slow Life is an EP by the Welsh alternative rock band Super Furry Animals , released in 2004 . 

The EP was made available as a free download and also saw a limited CD release , bundled with remix album Phantom Phorce . 

Lead track " Slow Life " appeared on the 2003 album Phantom Power and was originally composed as a purely electronic song by keyboardist Cian Ciaran several years earlier . 

The band were keen to finish the track and Ciaran encouraged them to jam over his original version â€” this jam was then edited and made into the finished song . 

The track " Motherfokker " is a collaboration between the Super Furry Animals and rap group Goldie Lookin Chain . 

The EP received mixed reviews although " Slow Life " itself was singled out for praise by many critics . 

A music video was made to accompany the track directed by Dylan Jones and Paps O'Maoileoain . 

The Super Furries appeared in the 2004 film 9 Songs playing " Slow Life " live during a scene in which one of the characters attends a gig by the band at the Brixton Academy .
