Most areas of New England are entirely divided into incorporated municipalities , with no unincorporated territory . 

In the three northern New England states , however , some unincorporated territory does exist , generally in areas that are very sparsely populated . 

Maine contains significantly more unincorporated territory than the other states , with the bulk of it in interior and northern counties . 

Some southern and coastal counties , including Lincoln County , also contain smaller amounts of unincorporated territory , however . 

Some unincorporated territory in Maine is organized into a third type of town - level municipality unique to Maine , called a plantation ( considered to be “ organized ” , but not incorporated ) , while some is entirely unorganized . 

Lincoln County currently contains one plantation ( Monhegan , which is located on offshore islands ) , as well as a small amount of territory that is entirely unorganized ( Hibberts Gore ) . 

Separate sections with census totals for unincorporated areas follows the main tables below . 

For any census , adding up the totals for each town - level municipality , including any plantations or unorganized entities , should yield the county total . 

Except for Monhegan and Hibberts Gore , all of Lincoln County is incorporated ; except for Hibberts Gore , all of the county is at least organized .
