" The Puerto Rican Day " is the 176th episode of the NBC sitcom Seinfeld . 

It aired on May 7 , 1998 , and was the 20th episode of the ninth and final season . 

It was the show 's second - highest - rated episode of all time , with 38.8 million viewers , only behind the series finale . 

The episode aired one week before the two - part clip show and the two - part series finale aired . 

Because of controversy surrounding a scene in which Cosmo Kramer accidentally burns and then stomps on the Puerto Rican flag , NBC was forced to apologize and had it banned from airing on the network again . 

Also , it was not initially part of the syndicated package . 

In the summer of 2002 , the episode started to appear with the flag - burning sequence intact . 

This episode of Seinfeld has more writer credits ( ten ) than any other episode . 

As co - creator Larry David was returning to write the finale , this was the final episode for the active " after Larry David " writing staff and thus was a group effort . 

" The Puerto Rican Day " was a rare late - series return to a " plot about nothing " style , filmed in real - time , more commonly seen in early seasons ( such as " The Chinese Restaurant " ) .
