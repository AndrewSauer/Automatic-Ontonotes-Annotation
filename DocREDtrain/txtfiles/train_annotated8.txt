Nicola Lake is a glacially formed narrow , deep lake located in the South - Central Interior of British Columbia , Canada approximately thirty kilometres northeast of the city of Merritt . 

It was a centrepoint of the first settlements in the grasslands lying south of Kamloops , and today is used for recreation and as a water storage site to provide irrigation and water flows to fisheries downstream in the Nicola River . 

The lake is important in the history of the local Nicola people as the location of one of their major communities , Nicola Lake Indian Reserve No . 

1 , which lies on its eastern shore and is the home of the Upper Nicola Indian Band . 

Many of the band work for the Douglas Lake Cattle Company , aka the Douglas Lake Ranch , whose headquarters are also adjacent to the lake .
