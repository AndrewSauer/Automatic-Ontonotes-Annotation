Franklin District was a New Zealand territorial authority that lay between the Auckland metropolitan area and the Waikato Plains . 

As a formal territory it was abolished on 31 October 2010 and divided between Auckland Council in the Auckland Region ( 39.82 percent by land area ) to the north and Waikato and Hauraki districts in the Waikato Region ( 60.18 percent ) to the south and east . 

The Auckland portion is now part of the Franklin ward , which also includes rural parts of the former Manukau City . 

Before its abolition , it was administered from the town of Pukekohe . 

Out - going Franklin District Mayor Mark Ball had proposed that Franklin district become an independent unitary authority , fulfilling both the functions of a local and regional council . 

However , this was rejected by Minister Rodney Hide .
