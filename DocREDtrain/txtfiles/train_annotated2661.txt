Though most famous for his involvement in the Hōgen Rebellion , Minamoto No Tameyoshi is also said to have intervened in a number of other conflicts earlier in his life . 

Around 1113 , the ongoing rivalry between the warrior monks of Mii - dera and Enryaku - ji erupted into outright violence in the streets of Kyoto . 

Though the palace guard mobilized quickly to protect the Emperor , it is said that Tameyoshi , with a handful of mounted samurai , drove the mobs away himself . 

Upon being defeated in the Hōgen Rebellion , Tameyoshi took the tonsure and was released into the custody of his son Minamoto no Yoshitomo who then had him beheaded . 

This was an unprecedented breaking of Buddhist values in Japan , yet no one in the court berated Yoshitomo for his actions at the time until after his death .
