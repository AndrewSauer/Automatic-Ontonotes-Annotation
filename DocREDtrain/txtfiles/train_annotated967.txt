The People 's Republic of China 's first reported AIDS case was identified in 1985 in a dying tourist . 

In 1989 , the first indigenous cases were reported as an outbreak in 146 infected heroin users in Yunnan province , near China 's southwest border . 

Yunnan is the area most affected by HIV / AIDS in China . 

In 1989 first infections appeared among needle sharing drug users near the Burmese border . 

Up until 1993 , the disease had remained a problem in the border areas before mobile people ( truck drivers , construction and migrant workers and travelers ) brought the virus further into the country . 

In 1995 , the provinces of Sichuan and Xinjiang reported their first HIV cases , and by 1998 , the virus had spread all over China . 

Low awareness of the disease among China 's general population appears to be a major culprit . 

Most Chinese consider HIV / AIDS as a foreign issue , and even educated people are less knowledgeable of the virus , its transmission and prevention , than people in other countries . 

Until recently , the use of condoms was not very common , even among sex workers and their clients . 

As a result , the epidemic has spread from high - risk groups ( drug users , sex workers , unsafe blood donors ) to the general population .
