There were widespread reports of systematic and escalating violations of human rights in Zimbabwe under the regime of Robert Mugabe and his party , ZANU - PF between 1980 and 2017 . 

According to human rights organisations such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch the government of Zimbabwe violates the rights to shelter , food , freedom of movement and residence , freedom of assembly and the protection of the law . 

There are assaults on the media , the political opposition , civil society activists , and human rights defenders . 

Opposition gatherings are frequently the subject of brutal attacks by the police force , such as the crackdown on an 11 March 2007 Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) rally . 

In the events , party leader Morgan Tsvangirai and 49 other opposition activists were arrested and severely beaten by the police . 

Edward Chikombo , a journalist who sent images of the beatings to foreign media , was abducted and murdered a few days later . 

After his release , Morgan Tsvangirai told the BBC that he suffered head injuries and blows to the arms , knees and back , and that he lost a significant amount of blood . 

The police action was strongly condemned by the UN Secretary - General , Ban Ki - moon , the European Union and the United States . 

While nothing that the activists had suffered injuries , but not mentioning the cause of them , the Zimbabwean government - controlled daily newspaper The Herald claimed the police had intervened after demonstrators " ran amok looting shops , destroying property , mugging civilians , and assaulting police officers and innocent members of the public " . 

The newspaper also argued that the opposition had been " wilfully violating the ban on political rallies " .
