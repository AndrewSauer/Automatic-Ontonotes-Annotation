Irene Scharrer ( 2 February 188811 January 1971 ) was an English classical pianist . 

Irene Scharrer was born in London and studied at the Royal Academy of Music with Tobias Matthay . 

Scharrer made her London d√©but at the age of 16 , and gave concerts regularly until June 1958 , where she appeared for the last time , playing Mozart 's Sonata for Two Pianos with Myra Hess . 

They often performed four - handed compositions together . 

( Scharrer is sometimes erroneously described as Hess 's cousin . 

She was distantly related to another fine woman pianist , Harriet Cohen , the two sharing a great - great - grandfather ) . 

Other collaborators included Arthur Nikisch in Berlin , and Landon Ronald in London . 

She visited Edward Elgar in 1918 and was promised the first performance of his piano concerto , then being sketched . 

Her technique was one of refinement rather than power . 

Her surviving recordings show her at her best in the smaller pieces of the romantic repertoire , where her impeccable control , fine tone and lack of showiness serve the music well .
