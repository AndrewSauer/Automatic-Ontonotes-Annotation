Germanía is the Spanish term for the argot used by criminals or in jails in Spain during 15th and 16th centuries . 

Its purpose is to keep outsiders out of the conversation . 

The ultimate origin of the word is the Latin word germanus , through Catalan germà ( brother ) . 

Some documentation for it occurs in picaresque works as early as the Spanish Golden Century , such as in Quevedo 's El Buscón . 

Some writers used it in poetry for comical effect . 

After the arrival of the Romani people and their frequent imprisonment , germanía incorporated much vocabulary from Romany and its descendant , the caló jargon . 

As time passed , several words entered popular use and even standard Spanish , losing their value for secrecy . 

Germanía survives today in the cheli jargon .
