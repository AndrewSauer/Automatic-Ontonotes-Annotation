Waylon J. Smithers Jr. , usually referred to as Mr. Smithers or simply Smithers , is a recurring fictional character in the animated sitcom The Simpsons , who is voiced by Harry Shearer . 

Smithers first appeared in the episode " Homer 's Odyssey " , although his voice could be heard in the series premiere " Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire " . 

He is the consummate executive and personal assistant of Springfield Nuclear Power Plant 's owner Mr. Burns . 

Smithers ' devotion to Mr. Burns was inspired from how numerous Fox executives and staff members acted towards Barry Diller . 

The idea for Smithers ' ambiguous sexual orientation came from Sam Simon , who proposed that Smithers should be gay , but little attention should be drawn to it . 

Smithers ' first name ( Waylon ) was derived from that of puppeteer Wayland Flowers . 

Smithers was colourized in his first appearance as black with blue hair . 

Matt Groening , in an interview with TMZ , said that this was a mistake but the producers did n't have enough money to correct it . 

Smithers is an obedient and sycophantic assistant to Mr. Burns , and the relationship between the two is a frequent running gag on The Simpsons . 

In many ways , Smithers represents the stereotype of a closeted gay man , and numerous overt allusions and double entendres concerning his homosexuality are made , though some of the show 's producers instead interpret him as a " Burns - sexual " . 

In the season 27 ( 2016 ) episode " The Burns Cage " , he came out as gay .
