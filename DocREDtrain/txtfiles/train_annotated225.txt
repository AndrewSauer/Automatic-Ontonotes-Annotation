The Catskill Escarpment , often referred to locally as just the Escarpment or the Great Wall of Manitou , and known as the Catskill Front to geologists , is the range forming the northeastern corner of the Catskill Mountains in Greene and Ulster counties in the U.S. state of New York . 

It rises very abruptly from the Hudson Valley to summits above in elevation , including three of the Catskill High Peaks , with almost no foothills . 

The plateau to the south and west averages above sea level . 

The Escarpment was the first area of the Catskills to attract the interest of European settlers . 

Botanist John Bartram wrote a widely read account of an expedition there prior to independence , and a century later the North - South Lake area he had visited became home to a number of exclusive resorts , including the Catskill Mountain House . 

Views of it inspired Thomas Cole and other painters of the Hudson River school , the first art movement in the United States . 

Today much of it is New York State Forest Preserve within the Catskill Park , and a popular place for hiking , camping and other outdoor recreation .
