Denis Nowell Pritt , QC ( 22 September 1887 â€“ 23 May 1972 ) was a British barrister and Labour Party politician . 

Born in Harlesden , Middlesex , he was educated at Winchester College and University of London . 

A member of the Labour Party from 1918 , he was a defender of the Soviet Union . 

In 1932 , as part of G. D. H. Cole 's New Fabian Research Bureau 's ' expert commission of enquiry ' , he visited the Soviet Union , and , according to Margaret Cole , " the eminent KC swallowed it all " . 

Pritt was expelled from the Labour Party in 1940 following his support of the Soviet invasion of Finland . 

Pritt was characterised by George Orwell as " perhaps the most effective pro - Soviet publicist in this country " .
