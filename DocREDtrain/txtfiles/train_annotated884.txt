Medical Center is an island platformed Washington Metro station in Bethesda , Maryland , United States . 

The station was opened on August 25 , 1984 , and is operated by the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority ( WMATA ) . 

Providing service for the Red Line , the station serves the National Institutes of Health campus and the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center and is located at Rockville Pike and South Drive . 

Since there is little retail in the area and no commuter parking lot , this station is used almost exclusively by employees and visitors to those two institutions . 

The station opened on August 25 , 1984 . 

Its opening coincided with the completion of of rail northwest of the Van Ness â€“ UDC station and the opening of the Bethesda , Friendship Heights , Grosvenor and Tenleytown stations . 

In September 2009 , Montgomery County submitted a $ 20 million federal grant application to build a pedestrian tunnel under Rockville Pike to improve access to the Medical Center stop from Walter Reed Medical Center . 

Currently , there is only a crosswalk here , with many passengers crossing the heavily travelled street from Walter Reed on the east side of MD 355 to get to the station on the west side . 

Construction would have originally occurred in 2011 , but the project was not approved until 2013 . 

The project is fully funded at $ 68 million , mostly through the Department of Defense , and includes installation of new deep elevators , improvement of surface bicycle and pedestrian facilities , as well as an extension of the left turn lane on southbound MD 355 . 

The project began construction in December 2017 , and is expected to be completed in late 2021 .
