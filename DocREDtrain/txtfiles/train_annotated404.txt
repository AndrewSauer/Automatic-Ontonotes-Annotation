The Texas Flood World Tour was a concert tour in North America and western Europe , undertaken by American blues rock band Stevie Ray Vaughan and Double Trouble from 1983 to 1984 . 

The band had released their debut album , Texas Flood , a week prior to the tour 's beginning . 

Their sensational talent was demonstrated during a trip to Switzerland in 1982 , when they held a jam session with Jackson Browne in a downstairs bar after playing at the Montreux Jazz Festival . 

Aware of the future opportunities that might accumulate from their performance and the first unsigned act on the festival , Browne offered Vaughan and Double Trouble free use of his personal studio to record Texas Flood . 

Throughout the tour , the group 's career status escalated as their performances continuously amazed and stunned their audiences . 

The first leg of the tour took the band to the United States and Canada , and then on to Europe where they toured for two weeks . 

They then returned to North America , where during a leg that lasted more than three months Vaughan and Double Trouble opened for Men at Work and The Moody Blues . 

The band then moved on to the Mid - Atlantic , where they concluded the leg before returning to the studio in January 1984 , although the tour resumed the following month . 

The final leg incorporated recurring stops in several cities and a visit to Hawaii , before the band 's return home in late February . 

The commercial success of the tour , though significant , did not alter the band 's modesty , and they continued in this career mindset . 

However , the tour enabled the group to experience the overseas concert circuit , and gave them massive exposure . 

In the case of Vaughan this would be ongoing through subsequent tours in the ensuing seven years , before his death in a helicopter crash in August 1990 .
