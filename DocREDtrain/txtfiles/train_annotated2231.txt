Da yuan shuai ( ta yuan shuai ; ) was a Chinese military rank , usually translated as grand marshal or generalissimo . 

During the early Republic of China , the rank of " grand marshal of the army and navy " ( 陸海軍大元帥 lù hǎijūn dàyuánshuài ) was assumed by Yuan Shikai in 1913 , Sun Yat - sen in 1917 and Zhang Zuolin in 1927 . 

The rank was replaced by the Nationalist Government with the " general special class " or " generalissimo " ( 特級上將 Tèjí shàng jiàng ) and awarded to Chiang Kai - shek in 1935 . 

The rank of " grand marshal of the People 's Republic of China " ( 中華人民共和國大元帥 Zhōnghuá rénmín gònghéguó dàyuánshuài ) was proposed after the establishment of the People 's Republic ( perhaps for Mao Zedong ) , but was never conferred .
