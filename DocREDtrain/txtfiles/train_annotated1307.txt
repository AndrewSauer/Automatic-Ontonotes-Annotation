The Loudoun County Commuter Bus , also known as Loudoun County Transit , is a public - transportation service provided by the Loudoun County , Virginia government . 

The buses operate from Dulles , Leesburg , and Purcellville to Washington Metro stations as well as directly to Rosslyn , Virginia , The Pentagon , and Washington , D.C .. 

The service is attractive because the buses , unlike normal traffic , are permitted to travel on the express lanes of the Dulles Toll Road . 

This allows for a shorter trip and also bypasses commuter tolls . 

The Loudoun County Commuter Bus accepts payment via SmarTrip , a reloadable transit card issued by the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority . 

Loudoun County Transit buses also operates local bus service through Sterling , Ashburn , & Leesburg . 

The Silver Line is being extended to Dulles Airport and Ashburn ( part of Phase Two ) , service is available from Park and Ride locations to the Wiehle - Reston East Metro station as well as the West Falls Church Station as part of Metro Connection service . 

Virginia Regional Transit only operates the Purcellville Connector that is part of local bus service . 

LC Transit uses long buses ( seating around 50 ) with white and metal trim and display the LC Transit logo ( shown above ) , 

while VRT buses are short ( seating around 15 ) and have a predominantly white and maroon color scheme , frequently without a logo . 

Meanwhile , the local buses have buses that are around the same size as VRT buses & have the LC logo .
