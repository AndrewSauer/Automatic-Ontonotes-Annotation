John Thornton Kirkland ( August 17 , 1770 – April 26 , 1840 ) served as President of Harvard University from 1810 to 1828 . 

As an undergraduate , he was a member of the Hasty Pudding . 

A religious minister like many of his predecessors , he is remembered chiefly for his lenient treatment of students . 

Kirkland House , one of Harvard 's undergraduate " houses , " or residence halls , was named in his honor and in recognition of his term at the school 's helm . 

Oliver Wendell Holmes describes him thus , in his study of Ralph Waldo Emerson : " His ' shining morning face ' was round as a baby 's , and talked as pleasantly as his voice did , with smiles for accents and dimples for punctuation ... 

It was of him that the story was always told ,-- it may be as old as the invention of printing ,-- that he threw his sermons into a barrel , where they went to pieces and got mixed up , and that when he was going to preach he fished out what he thought would be about enough for a sermon , and patched the leaves together as he best might . " 

His contemporary George Ticknor described Kirkland 's sermons as " full of intellectual wealth and practical wisdom , with sometimes a quaintness that bordered on humor . " 

Kirkland served as pastor of the New South Church in Boston , 1794 – 1810 . 

He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1799 . 

Kirkland was a founding member of the American Antiquarian Society in 1812 .
