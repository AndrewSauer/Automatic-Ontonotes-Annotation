The was a railway line in northern Japan linking Aomori Station in Aomori and Hakodate Station in Hokkaido . 

The Tsugaru - Kaikyō Line was actually made up of portions of four separate lines : the Tsugaru Line , operated by East Japan Railway Company , and the Kaikyō , Esashi , and Hakodate Main lines , operated by Hokkaido Railway Company . 

The name was created following the opening of the Kaikyō Line and Seikan Tunnel on March 13 , 1988 . 

The line name is out of use since March 26 , 2016 when the Hokkaido Shinkansen opened and replaced regular passenger services connecting Aomori and Hakodate on the Tsugaru - Kaikyō Line . 

The railway lines that formed the Tsugaru - Kaikyō Line continue to operate freight and passenger trains except for passenger trains on the Kaikyō Line section .
