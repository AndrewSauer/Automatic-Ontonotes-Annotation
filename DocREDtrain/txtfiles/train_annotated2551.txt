The son of state MP Leslie Webster , he was educated at Caulfield Grammar School and the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology . 

He worked as an accountant and farmer prior to entering politics . 

Webster was appointed to the Senate as a member of the Country Party following the death of Harrie Wade in 1964 , and served in the Senate until 1980 . 

He was the federal Minister for Science ( later Minister for Science and the Environment ) in the Fraser Government from 1975 to 1979 . 

In 1975 , his constitutional eligibility to sit in the Senate was questioned , prompting the Parliament to introduce the Common Informers ( Parliamentary Disqualifications ) Act 1975 , although ultimately the High Court found that he was not ineligible and he continued to serve until his retirement in 1980 .
