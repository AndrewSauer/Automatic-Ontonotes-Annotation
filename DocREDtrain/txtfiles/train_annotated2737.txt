Moolaadé ( " magical protection " ) is a 2004 film by the Senegalese writer and director Ousmane Sembène . 

It addresses the subject of female genital mutilation , a common practice in a number of African countries , from Egypt to Nigeria . 

The film was a co - production between companies from several Francophone nations : Senegal , France , Burkina Faso , Cameroon , Morocco , and Tunisia . 

It was filmed in the remote village of Djerrisso , Burkina Faso . 

The film argues strongly against the practice , depicting a village woman , Collé , who uses moolaadé ( magical protection ) to protect a group of girls . 

She is opposed by the villagers who believe in the necessity of female genital cutting , which they call " purification " .
