The National Call Party ( , hizb al - nida ' al - qawmi ) was a political party in Lebanon . 

The party was founded by Takieddin el - Solh and Ali Bazzi . 

Not really a formally structured party , it functioned as a political platform for the el - Solh family and drew support mainly from poor Sunnis in Beirut and Sidon . 

The party made some inroads in Tripoli ahead of the 1947 elections , in the wake of a corruption scandal damaging the position of local strongman Rachid Karami . 

Qabuli Zuq , elected to parliament in 1951 , was the chairman of the Tripoli branch of the party . 

In August 1952 the party formed an alliance called the Popular Front together with the Kataeb Party and the Muslim National Congress .
