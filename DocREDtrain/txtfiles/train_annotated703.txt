A private company limited by shares is a class of private limited company incorporated under the laws of England and Wales , Scotland , certain Commonwealth countries , and the Republic of Ireland . 

It has shareholders with limited liability and its shares may not be offered to the general public , unlike those of a public limited company ( plc ) . 

" Limited by shares " means that the liability of the shareholders to creditors of the company is limited to the capital originally invested , i.e. 

the nominal value of the shares and any premium paid in return for the issue of the shares by the company . 

A shareholder 's personal assets are thus protected in the event of the company 's insolvency , but any money invested in the company may be lost . 

A limited company may be " private " or " public " . 

A private limited company 's disclosure requirements are lighter , but its shares may not be offered to the general public and therefore can not be traded on a public stock exchange . 

This is the major difference between a private limited company and a public limited company . 

Most companies , particularly small companies , are private . 

Private companies limited by shares are usually required to have the suffix " Limited " ( often written " Ltd " or " Ltd. " ) or " Incorporated " ( " Inc. " ) as part of their name , though the latter can not be used in the UK or the Republic of Ireland . 

" Cyfyngedig " ( " Cyf . " ) 

may be used by Welsh companies in a similar fashion . 

In the Republic of Ireland " Teoranta " ( " Teo . " ) 

may be used instead , largely in Gaeltacht areas .
