The United African National Council ( UANC ) was a political party in Zimbabwe . 

In 1979 , led by Bishop Abel Muzorewa , the UANC Party held formal power in Zimbabwe during the short - lived period of the Internal Settlement . 

For this short period of time , Zimbabwe ( which had been called Rhodesia ) became known as Zimbabwe Rhodesia . 

In 1980 , during the Zimbabwean parliamentary election , the UANC Party was generally defeated by Robert Mugabe 's Zimbabwe African National Union â€“ Patriotic Front ( ZANU - PF ) Party . 

The UANC Party was unable to win any parliamentary seats in the 1985 and 1990 elections . 

The party joined with other opposition parties to form United Parties to support Muzorewa in the 1996 presidential election , but he subsequently pulled out ( albeit with his name remaining on the ballot ) . 

The party still exists today . 

Mugabe and his ZANU - PF Party have had almost total control over Zimbabwe since the early 1990s . 

But , with the economy of Zimbabwe in ruins , Muzorewa considered running again in 2008 .
