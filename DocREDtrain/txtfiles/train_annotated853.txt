Sphecomyrminae is an extinct subfamily of ants in family Formicidae known from a series of Cretaceous fossils found in North America , Europe , and Asia . 

Sphecomyrminae contains ten genera , divided into two tribes , Haidomyrmecini and Sphecomyrmini . 

The tribe Haidomyrmecini contains the four genera Ceratomyrmex , Haidomyrmex , Haidomyrmodes , Haidoterminus and Linguamyrmex , while Sphecomyrmini contains Baikuris , Cretomyrma , Dlusskyidris , Sphecomyrma , and Zigrasimecia . 

The genus Sphecomyrmodes was formerly placed into Sphecomyrmini ; however , in 2016 , it was made a synonym of the stem group genus Gerontoformica , which is considered incertae sedis in Formicidae . 

Sphecomyrminae is the most basal of the Formicidae subfamilies , but has not been included in several recent phylogenetic studies of the family . 

Symplesiomorphies of the subfamily include the structure of the antenna , which has a short basal segment and a flexible group of segments below the antenna tip . 

The petiole is low and rounded , with an unrestricted gaster and the presence of a metapleural gland . 

The subfamily is characterized by three major synapomorphies , the short pedicel , a second flagellar segment that is double the length of the other antenna segments , and the loss of the apical end of the CuA veins in the wings of adult males .
