The Maha Yazawin , fully the Maha Yazawindawgyi ( , ) and formerly romanized as the , is the first national chronicle of Burma / Myanmar . 

Completed in 1724 by U Kala , a historian at the Toungoo court , it was the first chronicle to synthesize all the ancient , regional , foreign and biographic histories related to Burmese history . 

Prior to the chronicle , the only known Burmese histories were biographies and comparatively brief local chronicles . 

The chronicle has formed the basis for all subsequent histories of the country , including the earliest English language histories of Burma written in the late 19th century . 

The chronicle starts with the beginning of the current world cycle according to Buddhist tradition and the Buddhist version of ancient Indian history , and proceeds " with ever increasing detail to narrate the political story of the Irrawaddy basin from quasi - legendary dynasties to events witnessed by the author himself in 1711 . " 

Since it was written in the late Toungoo period , the chronicle provides its most specific information on dates and descriptions of various events Toungoo kings partook . 

The chronicle 's portrayal of the 16th century Toungoo Burma , which was also witnessed by many Europeans , has been found by scholars to be largely factual . 

However , its narrative of the earlier periods is less detailed , showing that the author did not have the full versions of earlier chronicles . 

Moreover , he did not check any inscriptions , which would have yielded more specific dates and double - checked the events . 

Nonetheless , the pre-1712 portions of later national Burmese chronicles — including Yazawin Thit , Maha Yazawin Kyaw , and Hmannan Yazawin — are essentially verbatim reproductions of this chronicle , though the later chronicles did correct many of Maha Yazawin 's Pagan Dynasty and pre - Pagan dates based on epigraphic evidence .
