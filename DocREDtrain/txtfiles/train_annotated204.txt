Vladimír Dzurilla ( August 2 , 1942 in Bratislava , Slovakia – July 25 , 1995 in Düsseldorf , Germany ) was a Slovak ice hockey goaltender playing for Czechoslovakia . 

Dzurilla , a refrigerator repairman by profession , was goalie for the Czechoslovak national team for over 16 years , winning three gold , three silver and four bronze medals at world championships as well as one silver and two bronze Olympic medals . 

However , in most of these tournaments Dzurilla and Jiri Holecek were battling to be Czechoslovakia 's top goaltender and each were given their share of games . 

For North American fans , he is mostly known for stopping 29 shots in a 1 - 0 win over Canada in the 1976 Canada Cup ( where the Czechoslovaks finished second ) . 

He suffered a fatal heart attack at his home in Düsseldorf , Germany on July 25 , 1995 , only days before his 53rd birthday .
