The First Empire of Haiti (; Haitian Creole : Anpi an Ayiti ) was an elective monarchy in North America . 

Haiti was controlled by France before declaring independence on January 1 , 1804 . 

The Governor - General of Haiti , Jean - Jacques Dessalines , created the empire on September 22 , 1804 . 

Proclaiming himself Emperor Jacques I , he held his coronation ceremony on October 6 . 

The constitution of May 20 , 1805 set out the way the empire was to be governed , with the country split into six military divisions . 

The general of each division corresponded directly with the emperor , or the general in chief appointed by the emperor . 

The constitution also set out the succession to the throne , with the crown being elective and the reigning emperor having the power to appoint his successor . 

The constitution also banned white people , with the exception of naturalised Germans and Poles , from owning property inside the empire . 

Emperor Jacques I was assassinated on October 17 , 1806 . 

Two members of his administration , Alexandre Pétion and Henri Christophe , then assumed power , which led to a split in the country with Pétion leading the southern Republic of Haiti and Christophe leading the northern State of Haiti . 

Some 43 years later , on August 26 , 1849 , President Faustin Soulouque re - established an Empire in Haiti that lasted until January 15 , 1859 .
