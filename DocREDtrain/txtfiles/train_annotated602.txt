Islam in Angola is a minority religion . 

Most sources estimate the population at 90,000 , although some give a higher figure . 

Most Muslims in Angola are Sunni . 

They are generally foreign migrants from West Africa and the Middle East , although a few are local converts . 

There exist several Islamic organizations that run mosques , schools and community centers . 

The Association of the Development of Islam in Angola is the primary proselytizing organization . 

Muslim Angolans are represented by the Supreme Council of Angolan Muslims of Luanda . 

As of late 2013 , the Angolan government does not legally recognize any Muslim organizations ; as a result , mosques in the country have faced restrictions and many have been shut down by the government .
