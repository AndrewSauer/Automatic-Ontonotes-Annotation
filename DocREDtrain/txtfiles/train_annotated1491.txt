Chapter VIII of the United Nations Charter deals with regional arrangements . 

It authorizes regional organizations ( such as the African Union ) and even requires attempts to resolve disputes through such agencies ( if available ) prior to intervention by the UN Security Council . 

However , Article 53 provides that " no enforcement action shall be taken under regional arrangements or by regional agencies without the authorization of the Security Council . " 

Chapter VIII makes reference to enemy states , which were powers such as Japan and Germany that remained enemies of the UN signatories at the time of the promulgation of the UN Charter ( in the closing months of World War II in mid-1945 ) . 

There have been proposals to remove these references , but none have come to fruition . 

Chapter VIII is analogous to Article 21 of the Covenant of the League of Nations , which provides , " Nothing in this Covenant shall be deemed to affect the validity of international engagements , such as treaties of arbitration or regional understandings like the Monroe doctrine , for securing the maintenance of peace .
