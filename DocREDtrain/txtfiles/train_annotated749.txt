" Looking for the Perfect Beat " is an electro and old school hip hop song by Afrika Bambaataa & the Soulsonic Force . 

It was the second single from their album . 

Released in January 1983 , it served as the followup to the group 's highly influential song " Planet Rock " . 

The song was ranked at number 13 among the " Tracks of the Year " for 1983 by NME . 

Over the years , the single has attracted critical acclaim as an essential track in the history of early hip - hop music . 

Critic John Bush of Allmusic has remarked that the group had a " near - perfect homage to digital - era technology " , with its performers " freestyling over quintessentially electro ingredients like pin - point machine beats , electric drumpads , and arpeggiated sequencers . " 

It has also been revamped and sampled numerous times . 

" Looking for the Perfect Beat " was the basis for the British Hip hop and House crossover performer Bomb the Bass ' " Beat Dis " as well as Simon Harris ' similar hit , " Here Comes That Sound " , which came out in 1988 . 

U96 's single " Energie " ( 1998 ) also took inspiration . 

Samples of the track helped create LL Cool J 's song " Control Myself " and DJ Khaled 's song " Holla at Me " . 

The song was featured in the video game on the fictional radio station , Wildstyle .
