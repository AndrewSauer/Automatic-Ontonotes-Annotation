Union Peak is a heavily eroded shield volcano in the Cascade Range of central Oregon , located along the Cascade Crest less than southwest of the rim of Crater Lake . 

Ice Age glaciers eroded away most of the flanks of the volcano , leaving numerous deep cirques surrounding a central glacial horn . 

This is the same process that formed the summit horns of Three Fingered Jack , Mount Washington , Howlock Mountain , and Mount Thielsen from other shield volcanoes farther north in the Oregon Cascades . 

Union Peak is located within Crater Lake National Park , and the summit was used as a post for fire lookouts from the 1930s to the 1950s . 

A trail leads to the summit from the Pacific Crest Trail off Oregon Route 62 .
