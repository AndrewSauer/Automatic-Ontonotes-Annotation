False Cape Natural Area Preserve is a Natural Area Preserve located in Virginia Beach , Virginia , just north of the state border with North Carolina . 

The preserve covers a strip of largely undeveloped land located on False Cape between the Atlantic Ocean and Back Bay , and is one of the most undisturbed areas of coastal habitat remaining in the Mid - Atlantic . 

The preserve protects a variety of wetland and upland habitats , including maritime and swamp forest , interdunal wetlands , and Back Bay marshes . 

It also hosts various plants and animals rare in Virginia , more than two dozen in all ; many of these are southern species at the northern limit of their range in far southern Virginia . 

Many birds also come to the area during the fall and spring migrations . 

The preserve is owned and maintained by the Virginia Department of Conservation and Recreation as part of False Cape State Park , and comprises the undeveloped portions of the park ; these were dedicated as a Natural Area Preserve in 2002 . 

The preserve , like the remainder of False Cape State Park , is not publicly accessible by vehicle . 

The nearest parking is approximately from the preserve , which can be accessed by hiking , boating , or via a seasonal shuttle . 

Visitors must travel through Back Bay National Wildlife Refuge , which assesses a separate access fee .
