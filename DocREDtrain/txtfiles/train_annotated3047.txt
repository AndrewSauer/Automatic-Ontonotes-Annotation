Variety shows , also known as variety arts or variety entertainment , is entertainment made up of a variety of acts including musical performances , sketch comedy , magic , acrobatics , juggling , and ventriloquism . 

It is normally introduced by a comp√®re ( master of ceremonies ) or host . 

The variety format made its way from Victorian era stage to radio and then television . 

Variety shows were a staple of anglophone television from the late 1940s into the 1980s . 

While still widespread in some parts of the world , the proliferation of multichannel television and evolving viewer tastes have affected the popularity of variety shows in the United States . 

Despite this , their influence has still had a major effect on late night television whose late night talk shows and NBC 's variety series Saturday Night Live ( which originally premiered in 1975 ) have remained popular fixtures of North American television .
