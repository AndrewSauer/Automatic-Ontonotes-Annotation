The Wedding Church at Cana ( ) or simply Wedding Church , also Franciscan Wedding Church , is the name given to a religious building of the Catholic Church located in the central part of the town of Kafr Kanna ( Cana ) , in the Lower Galilee in northern Israel . 

It is dedicated to weddings . 

Its name commemorates an event from the Christian Gospel of John , known as The Wedding at Cana , during which Jesus performed the miracle of turning water into wine . 

The Church is owned by the Custody of the Holy Land , part of the Franciscan order in the Catholic Church . 

The current church was built circa 1881 , and expanded from 1897 - 1905 , following efforts by the Franciscans to acquire the site between 1641 and 1879 , when acquisition was completed . 

Twentieth - century archaeological excavations indicated that , before the current church building , the site housed a Jewish synagogue in the fourth and fifth centuries , and tombs under the rule of the Byzantine Empire in the fifth and sixth centuries . 

In 1901 the current facade was built , and September 30 , 1906 , Bishop Angelo Roncalli consecrated the altar . 

In the second half of the 1990s , the Holy Land began an extensive renovation of the church . 

The complete renovation of the church was completed in 1999 .
