Summit is an unincorporated community in Boyd County , Kentucky , United States on US 60 just west of Ashland . 

Summit serves as a suburb to the city of Ashland and shares the city 's ZIP code . 

Summit is sometimes spelled with two " T 's " at the end , although the most common spelling contains only one " T " but either variation is accepted as correct . 

Summit is a part of the Huntington - Ashland , WV - KY - OH , Metropolitan Statistical Area ( MSA ) . 

As of the 2000 census , the MSA had a population of 288,649 . 

The Summit name was first applied to a 19th - century railroad passenger and freight station located at the site . 

Summit was selected as descriptive of the location 's unique topographical features including a flat terrain on a higher elevation than other parts of the surrounding area . 

Unusual for the region , this terrain was created by the ancient Teay 's River and the associated Glacial Lake Tight . 

The Lexington , Elizabethtown , and Big Sandy Railroad opened a station here in the late 19th century after the railroad was constructed through Summit . 

It served the residents of what was then a sparsely populated farming community until the station was closed due to its close proximity to Ashland made it no longer necessary . 

Now a populated suburban area , Summit 's development was slow until the Federal Correctional Institution was located at the heart of Summit on Kentucky Route 716 . 

This and the upgrading of U.S. Route 60 , made transportation easier for residents to commute to and from Ashland .
