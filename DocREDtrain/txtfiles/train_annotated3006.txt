Wikitorial is a term coined by the Los Angeles Times to describe a traditional editorial that can be edited in the fashion of a wiki ( computer software that allows users to edit text and make changes to one document ) . 

On June 17 , 2005 the Los Angeles Times wrote the first Wikitorial , entitled War and Consequences , on the subject of the War in Iraq . 

Below that editorial the paper wrote an invitation to its readers to rewrite the editorial in the wiki fashion . 

They called the experiment a " public beta " and suggested that it might be either a failure or a new form of opinion journalism . 

Jimmy Wales , head of the Wikimedia Foundation , which governs Wikipedia , was one of the early contributors to the new Wikitorial which inspired a counterpoint editorial , redirections and much discussion .
