Circus Black is the fourth full - length album by Finnish symphonic power metal band Amberian Dawn . 

Stratovarius vocalist Timo Kotipelto provides lead vocals on " Cold Kiss " and keyboardist Jens Johansson ( Stratovarius , Dio , Yngwie Malmsteen ’s Rising Force ) contributed a keyboard solo on " Crimson Flower . " 

The band commented on the album : " Circus Black is the most impressive AD album so far . 

Musically it represents the most sophisticated and most symphonic edge of AD - music . 

There ’s more diversity on this album than never before . 

This is the first time we used a real choir and we gathered some really excellent professional opera singers together to be able to achieve the best sounding choir possible . 

This choir was conducted by Mikko P. Mustonen from Pathos Music . 

He also arranged the choir and orchestral parts . 

We managed once again to get some world - class guests on this album . 

So , the production is our biggest so far and the final polish on this album was given by Teropekka Virtanen ( mixing engineer ) and Mika Jussila ( mastering engineer ) at legendary Finnvox Studios in Finland . " 

This album also marks the final album of the band to feature lead vocalist Heidi Parviainen as well as lead guitarist Kasperi Heikkinen and drummer Heikki Saari .
