Relayer is the seventh studio album from the English progressive rock band Yes , released in November 1974 by Atlantic Records . 

After keyboardist Rick Wakeman left the group in May 1974 over disagreements with the band 's direction , Yes entered rehearsals as four - piece at bassist Chris Squire 's home in Virginia Water , Surrey . 

During this period , they auditioned several keyboardists including Vangelis before choosing Swiss musician Patrick Moraz who incorporates elements of funk and jazz fusion on the album . 

Relayer is formed of three tracks , with " The Gates of Delirium " on side one and " Sound Chaser " and " To Be Over " on side two . 

Relayer received a mixed to positive reception from contemporary and retrospective critics . 

It reached number 4 on the UK Albums Chart and number 5 on the US Billboard 200 . 

A single of the closing section of " The Gates of Delirium " , titled " Soon " , was released in January 1975 . 

Relayer continued to sell , and is certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America ( RIAA ) for selling over 500,000 copies in the US . 

It was remastered in 2003 and in 2014 , both with previously unreleased tracks ; the latter includes new stereo and 5.1 surround sound mixes and additional tracks .
