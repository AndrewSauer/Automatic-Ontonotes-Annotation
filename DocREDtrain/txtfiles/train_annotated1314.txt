The Free Reformed Churches of North America ( FRCNA ) is a theologically conservative federation of churches in the Dutch Calvinist tradition with congregations in the United States and Canada . 

It officially adopted its current name in 1974 . 

These churches together confess the Bible to be the Word of God and believe it is faithfully summarized by the Belgic Confession , Heidelberg Catechism , and Canons of Dort . 

This denomination adheres to the five points of Calvinism . 

It is affiliated with the Christian Reformed Churches in the Netherlands ( Christelijke Gereformeerde Kerken - CGKN ) . 

The Free Reformed Churches of North America should not be confused ( although named quite similarly ) with the Free Reformed Churches of Australia or Free Reformed Churches of South Africa .
