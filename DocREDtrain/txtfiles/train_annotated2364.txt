Seventh - day Adventists believe that Ellen G. White , one of the church 's co - founders , was a prophetess , understood today as an expression of the New Testament spiritual gift of prophecy . 

Seventh - day Adventist believe that White had the spiritual gift of prophecy , but that her writings are inferior to the Bible , which has ultimate authority . 

According to the 28 Fundamentals the core set of theological beliefs held by the Seventh - day Adventist Church , states that Adventists accept the Bible as their only creed and can be read online on the website of the Seventh - day Adventist Church . 

The 18 of the 28 Fundamentals states the Adventists viewpoint on the Gift of Prophecy : 

According to one church document , " her expositions on any given Bible passage offer an inspired guide to the meaning of texts without exhausting their meaning or preempting the task of exegesis " . 

In other words , White 's writings are considered an inspired commentary on Scripture , although Scripture remains ultimately authoritative . 

Adventist believe she had the spiritual gift of prophecy as outlined in Revelation 19:10 . 

Her restorationist writings endeavor to showcase the hand of God in Christian history . 

This cosmic conflict , referred to as the " Great Controversy theme " , is foundational to the development of Seventh - day Adventist theology .
