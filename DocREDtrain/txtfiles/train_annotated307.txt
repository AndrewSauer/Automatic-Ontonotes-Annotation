El Lado Oscuro ( en : " The Dark Side " ) is the second studio album by power metal band DarkSun , released in 2004 . 

The band entered the studios at the end of 2003 . 

Just like El Legado , this album was recorded in Germany , with Ingo Cjavkoski in the production . 

This time the band had Dennis Ward on mixings . 

( who was better known for his work with Angra ) , and Lars Ratz ( from Metalium ) assisted on the vocals production . 

Once again the reviews were as good as they could possibly be , like " ... it 's a varied work , where power and heavy metal alternate and mi " , and " El Lado Oscuro is a really good power metal album " . 

Peavy Wagner ( of Rage fame ) performed vocals on a song , which was released as a bonus track on the album , entitled " Prisoners of Fate " .
