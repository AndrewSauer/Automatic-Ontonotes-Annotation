Nepal Television ( ) is the oldest and most watched television channel in Nepal . 

This was for many years the only television channel native to Nepal , but several others have recently begun operation . 

The News ( broadcast at 8:00 Â  p.m. ) is the channel 's most popular show , followed by comedy program Bhadragol , Meri Bassai and Jire Khursani . 

Other important TV channels in Nepal are NTV PLUS , NTV News which is owned by the Nepalese government . 

Private channels include AP1 TV , Kantipur Television , Image Channel , Channel Nepal , Avenues TV , Nepal 1 Television and Sagarmatha Television . 

Nepal 1 Television is broadcast from India . 

All except Nepal Television , Kantipur Television , Image Channel and NTV PLUS are satellite channels in Kathmandu valley . 

Several attempts are being made by media stakeholders to convert and transform NTV into a truly Public Service Broadcasting ( PSB ) entity . 

NTV , being currently owned by the government , has lost its editorial independence and is blamed for continuously being a government mouthpiece . 

As the country 's only largest and oldest television channel , a need for transforming its operation into the hands of the public is realized by media experts in Nepal .
