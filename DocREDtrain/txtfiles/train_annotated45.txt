Collins Street is a major street in the centre of Melbourne , Victoria in Australia . 

It was laid out in the first survey of Melbourne , the original 1837 Hoddle Grid , and soon became the most desired address in the city . 

Collins Street was named after Lieutenant - Governor David Collins who led a group of settlers in establishing a short - lived settlement at Sorrento in 1803 . 

The eastern end of Collins Street has been known colloquially as the ' Paris End ' since the 1950s due to its numerous heritage buildings , old street trees , high - end shopping boutiques , and as the location for the first sidewalk cafes in the city . 

Blocks further west centred around Queen Street became the financial heart of Melbourne in the 19th century , the preferred home of major banks and insurance companies , a tradition which continues today with the most prestigious office blocks and skyscrapers found along its length .
