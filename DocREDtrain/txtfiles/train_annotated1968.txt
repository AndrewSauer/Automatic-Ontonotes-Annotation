Edith Williams ( 24 June 1899 â€“ 24 November 1979 ) was a Canadian veterinarian , the second woman from the country to complete her training at the Ontario Veterinary College and life partner of Dr Frieda Fraser . 

Initially entering university in 1916 , Williams dropped out after one year . 

After a three - year trip abroad while she worked as a clerk in a bank and the Canadian immigration office , she returned to Toronto and took up farming on a farm she had inherited . 

After ten years of raising livestock , Williams was accepted into veterinary school and graduated in 1941 . 

For the next twenty - five years , she had a private small - animal veterinary practice in Toronto . 

During the periods when Fraser and Williams were separated , they wrote letters daily . 

Their correspondence was preserved and donated after Fraser 's death to the University of Toronto libraries . 

It is a unique portrait of lesbian life in the early twentieth century , as few such records have survived .
