Michael Ernest O'Nan ( August 9 , 1943 , Fort Knox , Kentucky – July 31 , 2017 , Princeton , New Jersey ) was an American mathematician , specializing in group theory . 

O'Nan received his PhD in 1970 from Princeton University under Daniel Gorenstein with thesis A Characterization of the Three - Dimensional Projective Unitary Group over a Finite Field . 

He was a professor at Rutgers University . 

In 1976 he found strong evidence for the existence of a sporadic group , which Charles Sims constructed . 

The group is now named the O'Nan group after O'Nan . 

The O'Nan – Scott theorem in group theory is also named after O'Nan , who discovered it independently from Leonard Scott . 

It describes the maximal subgroups of the symmetric groups .
