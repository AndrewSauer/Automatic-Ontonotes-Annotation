The Legislative Assembly of Lower Canada was the lower house of the bicameral structure of provincial government in Lower Canada until 1838 . 

The legislative assembly was created by the Constitutional Act of 1791 . 

The lower house consisted of elected legislative councillors who created bills to be passed up to the Legislative Council of Lower Canada , whose members were appointed by the governor general . 

The lower house was dissolved on March 27 , 1838 following the Lower Canada Rebellion and Lower Canada was administered by an appointed Special Council . 

With the Act of Union in 1840 , a new lower chamber , the Legislative Assembly of Canada , was created for both Upper and Lower Canada which existed until 1867 , when the Legislative Assembly of Quebec was created .
