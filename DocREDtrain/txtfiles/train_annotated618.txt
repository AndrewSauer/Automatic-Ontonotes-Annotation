Samuel Bigger ( March 20 , 1802 â€“ September 9 , 1846 ) was the seventh Governor of the U.S. state of Indiana from December 9 , 1840 to December 6 , 1843 . 

Bigger was nominated to run for governor because he had no connection to the failed public works program . 

The state had entered a severe financial crisis in his predecessor 's term and the government became insolvent during his first year in office . 

He oversaw the state 's bankruptcy negotiations , but the bankruptcy he negotiated was only able to return the state to solvency briefly . 

By the time of his reelection campaign , the Whig Party had become the target of public blame for the debacle , and Bigger was defeated .
