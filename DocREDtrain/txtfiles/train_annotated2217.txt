The was a short undeclared military confrontation between the Empire of Japan and the French State in northern Indochina . 

Fighting lasted from 22 to 26 September 1940 , simultaneous with the Battle of South Guangxi in the Sino - Japanese War . 

The main objective of the Japanese was to prevent the Republic of China from importing arms and fuel through French Indochina along the Kunming â€“ Hai Phong Railway , from the Indochinese port of Haiphong , through the capital of Hanoi to the Chinese city of Kunming in Yunnan . 

Although an agreement had been reached between the French and Japanese governments prior to the outbreak of fighting , authorities were unable to control events on the ground for several days before the troops stood down . 

Per the prior agreement , Japan was allowed to occupy Tonkin in northern Indochina and effectively blockade China .
