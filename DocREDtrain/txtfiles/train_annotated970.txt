The Quba Mosque ( ) is a mosque in the outlying environs of Medina , Saudi Arabia . 

Depending on whether the Mosque of the Companions in the Eritrean city of Massawa is older or not , it may be the first mosque in the world that dates to the lifetime of the Islamic Nabī ( , Prophet ) Muhammad in the 7th century CE , and depending on whether the religion of Islam started with him or preceded him , it is either the first mosque in the history of Islam , or it is not the first , with the Great Mosques of Mecca and Jerusalem being older , due to their association with earlier Prophets in Islam , especially Abraham . 

According to legend , its first stones were positioned by Muhammad as soon as he arrived on his emigration from the city of Mecca to Medina , and the mosque was completed by his companions . 

Muhammad spent 14 days in this mosque praying qaṣr ( , a short prayer ) while waiting for Ali to arrive in Medina after the latter stayed behind in Mecca to carry out a couple of tasks entrusted to him by the Prophet . 

According to Islamic tradition , performing Wuḍū’ ( , ' Ablution ' ) in one 's home then offering two Rakaʿāṫ ( ) of Nafl ( , Optional ) prayers in the Quba Mosque is equal to performing one ‘ Umrah ( ) . 

Muhammad used to go there , riding or on foot , every Saturday and offer a two rakaʿāt prayer . 

He advised others to do the same , saying , " Whoever makes ablutions at home and then goes and prays in the Mosque of Quba , he will have a reward like that of an ' Umrah . " 

This ḥadīth ( ) was reported by Ahmad ibn Hanbal , Al - Nasa'i , Ibn Majah and Hakim al - Nishaburi .
