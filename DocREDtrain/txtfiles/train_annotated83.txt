Spiritchaser is the seventh studio album by Dead Can Dance , and the last before Brendan Perry and Lisa Gerrard went their separate ways . 

It expands on its exploration of world music , and like Into the Labyrinth , was recorded at Quivvy Church , Perry 's personal studio in Ireland . 

The album was dedicated to Lisa Gerrard 's deceased brother , Mark Gerrard . 

The track " Indus " contains a melody that is very similar to that of " Within You Without You " , a Beatles song that George Harrison wrote and recorded with Indian musicians in 1967 . 

Although not deliberate , Perry and Gerrard were asked to contact Harrison for his permission to use it ; he granted it , but the record company insisted that they give him partial songwriting credit on " Indus " .
