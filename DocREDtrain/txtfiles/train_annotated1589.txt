Timagenes ( ) was a Greek writer , historian and teacher of rhetoric . 

He came from Alexandria , was captured by Romans in 55 BC and taken to Rome , where he was purchased by Faustus Cornelius Sulla , son of Sulla . 

It is said that Timagenes had a falling - out with emperor Augustus , whereupon he destroyed his writings and fled Rome . 

He also asked Cleopatra to deliver Mark Antony to the Octavianus , or have him put to death . 

During his life Timagenes wrote a Universal History ( until the time of Caesar ) and a History of the Gauls . 

These works did not survive but are known through quotations in other historians . 

For example , the History of the Gauls is quoted in the works of Ammianus Marcellinus . 

It is sometimes credited as the source for Pompeius Trogus 's Philippic Histories , which survive in Justin 's epitome . 

In Albanum , after dinner , he attempted to vomit , during which he choked and died ; thus says the Suda .
