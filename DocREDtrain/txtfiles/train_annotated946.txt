Cape Arkona ( ) is a 45-metre - high cape on the island of Rügen in Mecklenburg - Vorpommern , Germany . 

It forms the tip of the Wittow peninsula , just a few kilometres north of the Jasmund National Park . 

The protected landscape of Cape Arkona , together with the fishing village of Vitt , belongs to the municipality of Putgarten and is one of the most popular tourist destinations on Rügen , receiving about 800,000 visitors annually . 

On the cape there are two lighthouses , a navigation tower , two military bunker complexes , the Slavic temple fortress of Jaromarsburg and several tourist buildings ( restaurants , pubs and souvenir shops ) . 

Because of its geology and the weathering that occurs here , there are frequent coastal collapses , especially in winter . 

Cape Arkona is often referred to as " the northernmost point of Rügen " , which is not true . 

Approximately one kilometre to the north - west , there is a point on the steep coast , known as the Gellort , which is a little further north . 

Directly at the foot of the Gellort is a 165-ton glacial erratic boulder known as the Siebenschneiderstein ( Low German : Söbenschniedersteen ) . 

The cape offers an impressive view of the island , both from land or sea .
