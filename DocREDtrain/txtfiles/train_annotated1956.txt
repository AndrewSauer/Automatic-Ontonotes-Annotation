The music of Northeast China is influenced by the folk traditions of the Manchu and other ethnic groups in the region . 

There is a great variety of music in the region , with the most well known throughout China possibly being the Youyouzha , a kind of lullaby that has spread throughout the country . 

Prominent performers from the Northeast include the mid-20th - century film composer Lei Zhenbang and pop stars Xiao Ke and Na Ying . 

Ethnic Manchu music is dominated by percussion instruments and it has largely been influenced by their native shamanism . 

Two forms of drum prevail , the wooden framed imcin , and the metal framed dangu which also has a handle attached to the ring . 

The dangu is the instrument most strongly identified with Manchu shamans . 

The octagonal drum is an important and distinctive musical instrument , said to derive from one made from eight pieces of wood given by the eight tribes of the Manchu people , thus symbolizing the unity of these tribes . 

During the Qing Dynasty , the instrument spread to Beijing and Tianjin , and is still known there
