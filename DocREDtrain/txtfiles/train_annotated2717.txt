Carin Mannheimer ( born Karin Birgitta Jacobson ; 17 August 1934 â€“ 11 July 2014 ) was a Swedish dramatist , screenwriter , author and film director , born in Osby , Sweden . 

She garnered acclaim with Rapport om kvinnor ( swedish : Report on Women ) , which was published in 1969 . 

The book is a collection of interviews with Swedish women from the working class . 

This was during a time period of awakening feminism in Sweden when women were assumed to want to work outside the home . 

The interviews , however , revealed that many women did not want to work outside the home , would have preferred to care for their children but had no economic choice . 

For this reason , Mannheimer was criticized by the women 's movement in Sweden , and the book established her reputation as a social critic .
