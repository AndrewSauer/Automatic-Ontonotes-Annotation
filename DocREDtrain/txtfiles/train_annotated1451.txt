The Asian Super Grid is a project to establish an electrical power transmission network , or super grid , connecting China , South Korea , Mongolia , Russia , and Japan . 

It will transmit electrical power from renewable sources from areas of the world that are best able to produce it to consumers in other parts of the world . 

The idea is dependent on development of an ultra - high voltage grid operating at more than 1,000 kilovolts AC and 800 kilovolts DC over thousands of kilometers . 

It envisions interconnecting grids across regions , nations , and even continents with a capacity of over 10 gigawatts . 

The concept is the result of an idea by Masayoshi Son , founder and head of the telecom and Internet giant SoftBank Group . 

After the devastation at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant following the 2011 Tohoku earthquake , Son was so shocked by events that he established the Renewable Energy Institute soon afterwards to help develop and promote renewable energy .
