Puddletown is a village and associated civil parish in the West Dorset district of Dorset , England . 

The village is situated about northeast of the county town Dorchester and is sited by the River Piddle , from which it derives its name . 

It also used to be known as Piddletown , but this fell out of favour , probably because of the alternative meaning of the word " piddle " . 

The name Puddletown rather than Piddletown was officially sanctioned in the late 1950s . 

Puddletown 's civil parish covers and extends to the neighbouring River Frome to the south . 

In 2013 the estimated population of the civil parish was 1,450 . 

Puddletown 's parish church has significant architectural interest , particularly its furnishings and monuments . 

It has a 12th - century font and well - preserved woodwork , including 17th - century box pews . 

Thomas Hardy took an interest in the church , and the village provided the inspiration for the fictional settlement of Weatherbury in his novel Far from the Madding Crowd ; Weatherbury Farm , the home of principal character Bathsheba Everdene , is based on a manor house within the parish .
