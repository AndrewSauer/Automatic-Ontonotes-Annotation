The foreign relations share the Bangladeshi government 's policies in its external relations with the international community . 

The country pursues a moderate foreign policy that places heavy reliance on multinational diplomacy , especially at the United Nations and World Trade Organization ( WTO ) . 

Since independence in 1971 , the country has stressed its principle of " Friendship towards all , malice towards none " in dictating its diplomacy . 

As a member of the Non - Aligned Movement , Bangladesh has tended to not take sides with major powers . 

Since the end of the Cold War , the country has pursued better relations with regional neighbours . 

Inspired by Sheikh Mujibur Rahman 's vision for a Switzerland of the East , the Bangladesh government has begun to translate the ideal into a foreign policy that pursues regional economic integration in South Asia and aims to establish Bangladesh as a regional hub of transit trade in Asia .
