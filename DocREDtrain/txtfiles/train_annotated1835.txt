Main Street ( Ottawa Road # 72 ) is an arterial road in Ottawa , Ontario , Canada . 

Main Street begins at Colonel By Drive near the community of Sandy Hill and runs in a straight line south until it bends near the Rideau River and becomes Smyth Road . 

Main Street is home to the Cuban embassy , Immaculata High School and Saint Paul University . 

For most of its length it runs parallel with the Rideau River and the Rideau Canal , being about halfway between them . 

Despite the name , the street is not Ottawa 's " main street " , as one would argue that that title would be held by Bank Street . 

Main Street however is the " main street " for the community of Ottawa East . 

It was originally the main street of Archville , Ontario , which later amalgamated with Ottawa in 1907 . 

At that time Ottawa had no other street called Main and the name was not changed .
