Wake of the Flood is the sixth studio album by rock band the Grateful Dead . 

Released October 15 , 1973 , it was the first album on the band 's own Grateful Dead Records label . 

Their first studio album in nearly three years , it was also the first without founding member Ron " Pigpen " McKernan , who had recently died . 

His absence and keyboardist Keith Godchaux 's penchants for bebop and modal jazz ( rather than McKernan 's tendencies toward the blues and soul music ) contributed to the band 's musical evolution . 

Godchaux 's wife , backing vocalist Donna Jean Godchaux , also joined the group and appears on the album . 

The release fared better on the pop charts than their previous studio album ( 1970 's American Beauty ) , reaching Â  18 . 

An expanded version was released in 2004 .
