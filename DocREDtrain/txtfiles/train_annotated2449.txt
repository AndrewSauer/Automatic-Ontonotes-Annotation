John Small ( August 27 , 1746 â€“ July 18 , 1831 ) was a political figure in Upper Canada . 

He was born in Cirencester , England in 1746 . 

In 1792 , he was appointed clerk of the Executive Council of Upper Canada . 

He was also a justice of the peace and a lieutenant in the militia . 

He came to Canada with John Graves Simcoe and built one of the first residential homes in York ( now Toronto ) . 

His son , Charles Small , expanded the home which was later called Berkeley House . 

It became a prominent Toronto home until it was torn down and turned into a brewery . 

In January 1800 , he fought a duel with John White , the attorney general for the province . 

White had insulted Small 's wife 's honour after a quarrel between the two men 's wives . 

Major John Small shot White in the hip , a wound he died from a few days later . 

He was charged with and acquitted of murder , even though the presiding judge , Henry Allcock , claimed to be a friend of White . 

Small 's reputation in the elite society of York was ruined by the affair . 

As a result of land speculation , he was able to achieve some level of prosperity . 

He died at Toronto in 1831 . 

His elder son , James Edward , served in the legislative assemblies of Upper Canada and the Province of Canada . 

His younger son Charles Coxwell Small , followed in his footsteps , and Chief Clerk .
