The Government of the Autonomous Republic of Abkhazia ( ) is an administration recognized by Georgia as the legal and only government of Abkhazia . 

Abkhazia has been de facto independent of Georgiathough with very little international recognitionsince the early 1990s . 

Vakhtang Kolbaia , elected in April 2013 , is the current head of the government - in - exile . 

After the War in Abkhazia ( 1992 â€“ 1993 ) Georgia proposed five - party talks involving the Government of the Autonomous Republic , the government of the de facto authorities of Abkhazia , and the government of Georgia , along with Russia and the UN as interested parties , in order to settle the final status of Abkhazia within the framework of the Georgian state . 

The Abkhaz side wanted assurances that Georgia would not try to solve the issue by force of arms before being a party to the talks . 

Between September 2006 and July 2008 , the Georgian recognized government was headquartered in Upper Abkhazia . 

However it was forced out of all of Abkhazia in August 2008 during the Russo - Georgian war by the Abkhazian armed forces . 

Upper Abkhazia is a territory that has population of c. 2,000 ( 1 - 1.5 % of Abkhazia 's post - war population ) and is centered on the upper Kodori Valley ( roughly 17 % of the territory of the former Abkhaz ASSR ) . 

The government - in - exile is partly responsible for the affairs of some 250,000 internally displaced persons who were forced to leave Abkhazia following the War in Abkhazia and the resulting ethnic cleansing of Georgians from the area .
