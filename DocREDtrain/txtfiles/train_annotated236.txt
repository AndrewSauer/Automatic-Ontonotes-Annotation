The Center for Free Enterprise ( in Korean 자유기업원 ) is a libertarian and formerly neoconservative think - tank based in Seoul , South Korea . 

Although the CFE was originally established upon the libertarian belief according to the philosophy of Friedrich Hayek and Ludwig von Mises , in later years , it expressed neoconservative , authoritarian or even McCarthyist ideas . 

For example , CFE enthusiastically advocated the nationalization of history textbooks in Korea , which was mainly discussed under the Park Geun - hye administration . 

Some libertarian scholars considered that the CFE had ruined libertarian ideas . 

However , after the impeachment of the Park administration , in 2017 , the CFE changed its name from " 자유경제원 " to " 자유기업원 , " endeavoring to exclude authoritarian and un - libertarian ideas and to become the true libertarian think tank of Korea .
