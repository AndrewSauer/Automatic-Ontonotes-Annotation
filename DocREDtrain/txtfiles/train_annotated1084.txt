It was released as a digital download on 12 September 2011 in Sweden . 

The song has peaked to number 26 on the Swedish Singles Chart six months later due to her victory at Melodifestivalen 2012 with Euphoria . 

A remixed version of the song was included on Loreen 's debut album Heal ( 2012 ) . 

Album remix version received favorable reviews . 

Scandipop.co.uk claimed that the singles ( including this song ) do n’t ever " dip below being a 9.5 out of 10 moment . " 

Higher Plain Music wrote positively claiming that it " returns to the catchy low - key whispery verse / vocal display chorus over earlier tracks " but that is more stop / start to make big distinctions " comparing to other songs in album . 

EscXtra praised the production : " this mix has given added strength to this track ( ... ) so it would fit with the whole album . " 

However the same critic criticized the vocal editing : " the effect of her voice delivering the lyrics is a little compromised compared to how it used to sound . 

I would have liked to have had the original cut of “ Sober ” as a bonus track at the end . "
