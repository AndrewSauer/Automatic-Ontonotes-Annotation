The Bonaparte Pottery Archeological District is a nationally recognized historic district located in Bonaparte , Iowa , United States . 

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1999 . 

At the time of its nomination it contained four resources , which included one contributing building , one contributing site , and two non - contributing buildings . 

The contributing resources include the remains of two kilns from Bonaparte Pottery , which operated from 1866 to 1895 . 

It also includes the factory building ( 1876 ) that replaced a building that was destroyed in a fire in November 1875 . 

The non - contributing resources include two buildings that are associated with the lumberyard that took over the site after the pottery closed . 

They were built after the period of historical significance . 

While modest in size compared with Red Wing Pottery in Minnesota and Western Stoneware in Illinois , Bonaparte Pottery was mid - sized operation associated with the pottery industry in Iowa . 

Pottery had a significant economic impact on the state from the mid to the late 19th - century . 

The Des Moines River Valley had the greatest concentration of potteries in the state because of the abundant coal deposits located there . 

Fire clay , which is used to manufacture ceramics , was a by - product of coal mining . 

Sidney Parker and Thomas Hanback founded the business in 1866 . 

Robert Wilson and Henry Jones joined the business in its later years . 

The pottery went out of business in 1895 for a variety of reasons . 

The financial panic of 1893 undoubtedly played a part , but Bonaparte experienced a severe decline in manufacturing that began in the 1890s . 

Other pottery operations had improved their mechanization , they had a better quality of clay , and they were located closer to population centers where they could sell their products .
