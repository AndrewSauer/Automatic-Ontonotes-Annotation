The Rhodes blood libel was an 1840 event of blood libel against Jews , in which the Greek Orthodox community accused Jews on the island of Rhodes ( then part of the Ottoman Empire ) of the ritual murder of a Christian boy who disappeared in February of that year . 

Initially the libel garnered support from the consuls of several European countries , including the United Kingdom , France , the Austrian Empire , Sweden , and Greece , although later several supported the Jewish community . 

The Ottoman governor of Rhodes broke with the long tradition of the Ottoman governments ( which had previously denied the factual basis of the blood libel accusations ) and supported the ritual murder charge . 

The government arrested several Jewish subjects , some of whom were tortured and confessed . 

It blockaded the entire Jewish quarter for twelve days . 

The Jewish community of Rhodes appealed for help from the Jewish community in Constantinople , who forwarded the appeal to European governments . 

In the United Kingdom and Austria , Jewish communities gained support from their governments . 

They sent official dispatches to the ambassadors in Constantinople unequivocally condemning the blood libel . 

A consensus developed that the charge was false . 

The governor of Rhodes sent the case to the central government , which initiated a formal inquiry into the affair . 

In July 1840 , that investigation established the innocence of the Jewish community . 

Finally , in November of the same year , the Ottoman sultan issued a decree ( firman ) denouncing the blood libel as false .
