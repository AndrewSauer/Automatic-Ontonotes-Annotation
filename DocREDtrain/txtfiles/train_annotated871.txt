OSCAR ( Open System for CommunicAtion in Realtime ) is AOL 's flagship instant messaging and presence information protocol . 

It was used by AOL 's AIM instant messaging system and ICQ . 

Despite its name , the specifications for the protocol remain proprietary . 

AOL has gone to great lengths to keep competitors ( namely Microsoft , XMPP , and Cerulean Studios ) from implementing compatible clients for their proprietary messaging systems . 

In 2002 , AOL signed a contract with Apple , Inc. , allowing them to use OSCAR ( as well as AOL 's own code libraries ) in their iChat application . 

This allowed iChat users to interact with ICQ and AIM users directly . 

The deal also permitted users of Apple 's .Mac service to log into the AIM network using their .Mac email addresses . 

( This has carried over to Apple 's MobileMe service . ) 

The OSCAR protocol can be used separately from AOL 's network . 

In fact , AOL expands on the general concept of OSCAR , adding systems for service side buddy lists and icons , as well as features for file transfers ( using Bonjour . ) 

On March 6 , 2006 , AOL released the AIM SDK and launched a developer website , allowing developers to build plugins for AIM Triton , and build their own custom clients , which connect over the OSCAR protocol . 

They had not , at that point , however , released any information about the protocol itself . 

On March 5 , 2008 , AOL released portions of the OSCAR protocol documentation . 

Google also provided the ability to sign into AIM network via the Google Talk client built into Gmail .
