Wazirwola ( wazīrwāla , meaning " of the Wazirs " ) , or Waziri ( ) , is an east - central Pashto dialect spoken in North Waziristan , South Waziristan , Bannu and parts of Tank in Pakistan , and in certain adjacent districts of Paktika , Khost and Paktia provinces of Afghanistan . 

The Wazir dialect is almost identical to the dialect spoken around Urgon ( eastern Paktika province ) and the Bannuchi dialect of Bannu , and somewhat resembles the dialect spoken by Khattaks in Karak . 

The dialects of Loya Paktia like Khosti and Zadrani are also very closely related , except that they are of the harsh northern variety . 

Wazirwola differs significantly in pronunciation and grammar from the standard literary Pashto based on the larger Kandahar , Kabul and Yousafzai dialects . 

The vowels [ a ] , [ ɑ ] , [ u ] and [ o ] of standard Pashto yield [ ɑ ] , [ o ] , [ i ] and [ e ] respectively , so [ paʂto ] becomes [ pɑɕte ] in Waziri . 

A special feature of Waziri is that the phonemes [ ʃ ] and [ ʂ ] , along with their voiced counterparts , [ ʒ ] and [ ʐ ] , have merged into the phonemes [ ɕ ] and [ ʑ ] , both of which also exist in the nearby Ormuri language of Kaniguram , South Waziristan . 

The Pashto alphabet has no symbol for their expression and the regular symbols of ژ and ش may be used . 

The standard Pashto word for " boy " , " هلک " [ halək ] , is rarely heard in Waziri , instead , " وېړکی " [ weɻkai ] meaning " little one " is used . 

The word " ləshki " [ ləɕki ] is used instead of the standard " لږ " [ ləʐ ] , " a little bit " . 

The pronoun موږ ( [ muʐ ] or [ mung ] ) , meaning " we " , is pronounced [ miʑ ] in Waziri . 

Waziri , like many other obscure Pashto dialects , is almost never written and its speakers may use standard Pashto as a literary language . 

Waziri Pashto is spoken by various tribes , and it is also called Maseedwola by the Mahsuds and Dawarwola by the Dawari . 

There are slight differences in pronunciation , for example , the phonemes [ t͡s ] and [ d͡z ] can become [ s ] and [ z ] , or even [ t͡ʃ ] and [ d͡ʒ ] , depending on the tribe or area the speaker is from .
