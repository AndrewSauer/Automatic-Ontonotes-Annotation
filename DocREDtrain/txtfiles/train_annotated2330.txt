Bawean ( ) is an island of Indonesia located approximately 150   km north of Surabaya in the Java Sea , off the coast of Java . 

It is administered by Gresik Regency of East Java province . 

It is approximately 15   km in diameter and is circumnavigated by a single narrow road . 

Bawean is dominated by an extinct volcano at its center that rises to 655 m above sea level . 

Its population as of the 2010 Census is about 70,000 people , but more than 26,000 of them ( that is about 70 % of the male population ) were temporarily living outside , working in other parts of Indonesia , Singapore and Malaysia ) . 

As a result , females constituted about 77 % of the actual population of the island , which is thus often referred to as the Island of Women ( ) .
