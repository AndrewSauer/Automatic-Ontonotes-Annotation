Cape Enrage is the name given to the southern tip of Barn Marsh Island , an island located in Albert County , New Brunswick , Canada , roughly half way along the coastline between the villages of Riverside - Albert and Alma at the eastern entrance to Fundy National Park . 

Accessible from Route 915 , the island itself is surrounded by jagged sea cliffs that are often more than 50 metres ( 145 Â  ft ) high , and is separated from the mainland by a narrow tidal creek . 

Cape Enrage derives its name from the large reef that extends south into Chignecto Bay , which causes the water off the point to become extremely violent , particularly at half tide when the reef is partially exposed and the water is moving quickly .
