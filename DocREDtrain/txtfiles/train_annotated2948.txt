The Indian Statutory Commission , commonly referred to as the Simon Commission , was a group of seven British Members of Parliament under the chairmanship of Sir John Allsebrook Simon . 

The commission arrived in British India in 1928 to study constitutional reform in Britain 's most important colonial dependency . 

One of its members was Clement Attlee , who became committed to Indian independence by 1934 and achieved that goal as Prime Minister in 1947 in the granting of independence to India and Pakistan . 

At the time of introducing the Montagu â€“ Chelmsford Reforms in 1919 , the British Government declared that a commission would be sent to India after ten years to examine the effects and operations of the constitutional reforms and to suggest more reforms for India . 

In November 1927 , the British government appointed a commission to report on India 's constitutional progress for introducing constitutional reforms , as promised . 

The Commission was strongly opposed by many in India and met with protests in every major Indian city it visited . 

Prominent Indian nationalist Lala Lajpat Rai led a protest in Lahore . 

He suffered a police beating during the protest , and died of his injuries two weeks later .
