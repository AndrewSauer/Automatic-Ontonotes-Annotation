Brain - Washing : A Synthesis of the Russian Textbook on Psychopolitics , sometimes referred to as The Brainwashing Manual , is a book published in 1955 . 

It purports to be a condensation of the work of Lavrentiy Beria , the Soviet secret police chief . 

The book states Kenneth Goff as author . 

Its true authorship is not clear , the three common hypotheses being : Scientology 's founder L. Ron Hubbard , Kenneth Goff ( alias Oliver Kenneth Goff ) , or both L. Ron Hubbard and Kenneth Goff based on an acquired US agency report . 

The third hypothesis is questionable as there is not proof that the two men ever knew each other . 

Claims that L. Ron Hubbard was the author are also dubious as the only source of this claim is his estranged son , L Ron Hubbard Jr. 

It is also sometimes referred to as The Communist Manual of Psycho - Political Warfare or the Communist Manual of Instructions of Psychopolitical Warfare .
