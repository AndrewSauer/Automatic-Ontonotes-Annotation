Epic And Other Hits is a compilation album released by Faith No More in 2005 . 

Despite the album 's title , only a handful of songs on it are actual hits , even though the band had other hits which do not appear here . 

The compilation greatly focuses on the band 's 1989 album The Real Thing , with six out of the ten tracks taken from it . 

Epic And Other Hits is generally considered a " weak " compilation , and many fans see it as a way to cash in on the success of Mike Patton . 

Most notably , the Mosley - era track " Arabian Disco " is included , from the We Care A Lot album , which is currently out of print on CD . 

The album also contains no tracks from King for a Day ... Fool for a Lifetime or Introduce Yourself . 

It is presumed that this album consists of a small selection of songs licensed by Warner Bros Records to the budget label Flashback , and as such no other songs could be included without breaching copyright . 

This compilation is generally not mentioned in the band 's canon due to their lack of involvement in it .
