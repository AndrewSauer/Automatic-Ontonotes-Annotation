Ataxia was a short - lived American experimental rock band formed in 2004 by guitarist John Frusciante ( Red Hot Chili Peppers ) , bassist Joe Lally ( Fugazi ) and drummer Josh Klinghoffer ( Red Hot Chili Peppers , Dot Hacker , The Bicycle Thief ) , who later succeeded Frusciante as the lead guitarist of the Red Hot Chili Peppers . 

Ataxia wrote and recorded songs for two weeks , and the material was separated into two albums : Automatic Writing ( 2004 ) and AW II ( 2007 ) . 

The songs all feature a ground - bass line with the guitar overlaying different motifs and long developments . 

In March 2008 , Lally described the band 's writing process : 

Ataxia performed two shows , both at the Knitting Factory in Los Angeles , on February 2 and February 3 , 2004 . 

Following this , the group disbanded . 

Josh Klinghoffer continued to work with Frusciante on his solo projects , and is the current guitarist for the Red Hot Chili Peppers , after Frusciante 's departure in 2009 .
