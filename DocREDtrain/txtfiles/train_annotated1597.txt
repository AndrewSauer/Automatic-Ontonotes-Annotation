Dr Arne A Bj√∂rnberg is the President of the company .

The Euro Health Consumer Index is a comparison of European health care systems based on waiting times , results , and generosity . 

The information is presented as a graphic index . 

Part of the motivation of the HCP in 2004 was to stimulate the European Union to take action on transparency and quality measures . 

The 2014 ranking included 37 countries measured by 48 indicators . 

The Euro Health Consumer Index measurements started in 2005 . 

During 2013 the European Commission assessed available systems for healthcare comparison including WHO , OECD , European Observatory and so forth and concluded that this is the most reliable . 

Scoring is partly based on the responses from patient organisations to a questionnaire , particularly when their responses indicate a radically different situation from that officially reported . 

976 responses were used in the 2015 exercise .
