The Second River , or Watsessing River , in the state of New Jersey in the United States , is the second main tributary of the Passaic River encountered while travelling upstream from its mouth at Newark Bay . 

From its source in West Orange to the Passaic , it is approximately 5   mi ( 8   km ) long . 

From West Orange , the Second River passes generally easterly through the towns of Orange and East Orange , where it is joined by Wigwam , Parrow , and Nishuane Brooks , then turns slightly to the north ( though still generally easterly ) , and enters the town of Bloomfield . 

Here , at Watsessing Park , it is joined by Toney 's Brook . 

After leaving Bloomfield , it enters the town of Belleville ( which was , early in its history , also named " Second River " ) , and turns slightly to the south ( though still generally easterly ) . 

Soon into Belleville , it forms the border between Belleville and Newark . 

Finally , it joins the Passaic River , on its way to Newark Bay . 

In the 19th and early 20th centuries , the Second River supported a sizable industrial complex of mills and factories . 

The Reformed Dutch Church of Second River is named after this river .
