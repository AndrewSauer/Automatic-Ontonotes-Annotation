In Norse Mythology , Óttar , also known as Óttar the Simple , is a protégé of the goddess Freyja . 

He appeared in Hyndluljóð ( the Lay of Hyndla ) , a poem in the Poetic Edda . 

In this tale , Óttar is said to be very pious to the goddesses . 

He built a shrine of stones , a hörgr , and on it made many offerings to Freyja . 

The goddess answered his prayers and went on a journey to help him find his pedigree . 

Freyja disguised Óttar as her boar Hildisvini ( the Battle - Swine ) and brought him to the giantess Hyndla , a seeress . 

There , Freyja forced Hyndla to tell Óttar about his ancestors , as well as to give him a memory potion so that he would remember all that he was told . 

It has been theorized that the framework of the poem was created for the 12th - century poet to produce a list of mythical heroes ' names . 

The poem does not connect much to other poems in the Edda , and is often viewed as a semi - historical work . 

Viktor Rydberg theorized that Óttar is another spelling of the name Óðr .
