Ger or Gur ( or Gerrer when used as an adjective ) is a Hasidic dynasty originating from Góra Kalwaria ( ) , a small town in Poland . 

The founder of the dynasty was Rabbi Yitzchak Meir Alter ( 1798 – 1866 ) , known as the Chiddushei HaRim after his primary scholarly work by that title . 

Before the Holocaust , followers of Ger were estimated to number in excess of 100,000 , making it the largest and most influential Hasidic groups in Poland . 

Today , the movement is based in Jerusalem , and its membership is estimated at 13,000 families , most of whom live in Israel , making Ger the largest Hasidic dynasty in Israel . 

However , there are also well - established Ger communities in Brooklyn , New York , and London , UK ; and minor Ger communities in Toronto , Ontario , Canada , and Los Angeles , California .
