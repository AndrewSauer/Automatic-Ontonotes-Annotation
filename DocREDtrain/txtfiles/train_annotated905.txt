Gerard Dillon ( 191614 June 1971 ) was an Irish artist . 

Born in Belfast , he left school at the age of fourteen and for seven years worked as a painter and decorator , mostly in London . 

From an early age he was interested in art , cinema , and theatre . 

About 1936 he started out as an artist . 

His Connemara landscapes provided the viewer with context , portraits of the characters who worked the land , atmosphere and idiosyncratic colour interpretations . 

Aged 18 , Dillon went to London , initially working as a decorator . 

With the outbreak of the Second World War , he returned to Belfast . 

Over the next five years he developed as a painter in Dublin and Belfast . 

His works during this period were more than simple depictions of the life and people around him , they were reactions and interactions in paint . 

In 1942 , his first solo exhibition was opened by his friend and fellow artist , Mainie Jellett at The Country Shop , St. Stephen 's Green , Dublin . 

" Father , Forgive Them Their Sins " featured depicting his concerns about the new war that had broken out . 

Despite a growing reputation , he had to return to London in 1944 to work on demolition gangs to restore his finances . 

In the late 1940s and during the 1950s , Dillon found himself favouring the town of Roundstone , Connemara . 

In 1958 , he had the double honour of representing Ireland at the Guggenheim International , and Great Britain at the Pittsburg International Exhibition . 

He travelled widely in Europe and taught for brief periods in the London art schools .
