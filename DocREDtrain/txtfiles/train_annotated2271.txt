Stenanthium densum is a poisonous but spectacular monocot wildflower native to pine barrens of the eastern United States . 

Stenanthium leimanthoides is either treated as a synonym of this species or as a separate species . 

It is known variously as Osceola 's plume , crowpoison , or black snakeroot . 

Within the family Melanthiaceae , it is placed in the tribe Melanthieae . 

Molecular phylogenetic studies in the 21st century have resulted in substantial rearrangement of the species in this tribe , many being moved to different genera . 

S.   densum was previously placed in Zigadenus as Z.   densum , and will be found under this name in older sources . 

It is native to the southernmost Gulf Coast , from eastern Louisiana east , down through most of Florida , and to the easternmost Atlantic Coast north to Rhode Island , seldom far from the coast .
