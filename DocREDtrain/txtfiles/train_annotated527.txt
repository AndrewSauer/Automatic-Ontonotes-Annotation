Sonnet is a song by Britpop band The Verve and is featured on their third album , Urban Hymns . 

It was released 2 March 1998 as the final single from the album ( see 1998 in British music ) . 

The song has the same instrumental layout as " The Drugs Do n't Work " , consisting of acoustic and electric guitars backed up with a string section which is mainly made up of violins . 

At the start of 1998 , Hut asked The Verve to put out another single from the album , an idea which the band disagreed with . 

Unusually , Hut pressed them on this matter , and so the band finally agreed to release " Sonnet " , but only in a format that would make it ineligible for chart recognition . 

Consequently , " Sonnet " was released as part of a set of four 12-inch records ( backed by " Stamped " , " So Sister " and " Echo Bass " ) . 

The release was limited to just 5000 copies , despite the huge radio coverage it received , and the official chart refused to recognize it as a single because of the extra content , as planned . 

The pack was released in a cardboard mailer , and the preceding three singles from the album , all re - released on the same day , fitted into the mailer . 

However , sales of an imported format resulted in it charting in the UK at # 74 . 

In Australia , " Sonnet " peaked at # 83 on the ARIA singles chart in January 1999 . 

" Sonnet " appeared on the MTV animated series Daria in the first episode of the third season , when she starts thinking about using contact lenses .
