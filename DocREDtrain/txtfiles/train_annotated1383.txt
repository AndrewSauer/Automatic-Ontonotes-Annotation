" Cool Places " is a song recorded by American pop band Sparks in collaboration with the Go - Go 's rhythm guitarist and backing vocalist Jane Wiedlin . 

The song was released as the lead single from Sparks 's 1983 album In Outer Space . 

At the time Sparks were at their most popular in the US , their two previous albums had dented the lower reaches of the Billboard 200 album chart . 

The single peaked at No . 

49 on the Hot 100 in April 1983 . 

The song 's success followed on from the success of their previous single and only other Hot 100 entry " I Predict " . 

Sparks recorded " Lucky Me , Lucky You " with Jane Wiedlin for the same parent album . 

Wiedlin also helped promote the album on tour and appeared at a few gigs to perform the duets . 

The song is a bit of an anomaly in Sparks ' back catalog , being one of the closest examples to a novelty song . 

Sparks have often been labelled a novelty act throughout their career . 

The song is at least representative of the style and content of their work in the mid-'80s . 

Wiedlin 's band , the Go - Go 's , performed the song on their 2006 tour , employing a more rock - driven style . 

The song continues to be a part of their live set . 

Alvin and the Chipmunks covered the song for their 2007 self - titled video game .
