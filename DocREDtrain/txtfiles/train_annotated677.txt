Sporhase v. Nebraska ex rel . 

Douglas , 458 U.S. 941 ( 1982 ) , was a case in which the United States Supreme Court decided that a Nebraska statute forbidding commercial exportation of water from Nebraska was unconstitutional in that it violated the dormant commerce clause . 

The boundary between the states of Nebraska and Colorado passed through a farm owned by Sporhase . 

He drilled a well in Nebraska and used the water to irrigate his land on both sides of the boundary . 

Under the 11th Amendment , he could not sue the state of Nebraska in a federal district court ; consequently his suit had to proceed in the state courts in Nebraska until he petitioned the United States Supreme Court to review it .
