Carlos Sastre Candil (; born 22 April 1975 ) is a former Spanish professional road bicycle racer and winner of the 2008 Tour de France . 

He consistently achieved great results in the Vuelta a Espa√±a and equally good showings in the Tour de France . 

Sastre established himself as a strong and stable climbing specialist , and after working to improve his individual time trial skills , he became a contender for the top GC spots in the Grand Tours . 

In total , Sastre finished in the top ten overall of fifteen Grand Tours during his career . 

Also remarkable is that Sastre never tested positive or was caught in a doping investigation given he performed at the top level of cycling for many years . 

Sastre continues to be widely regarded , following the Lance Armstrong affair , as one of the very few ' clean ' riders to have won the Tour de France in modern times as he has never been involved in a doping affair . 

In fact , with respect to doping allegations and admissions that have surrounded Tour winners in recent decades , Sastre has been called " Don Limpio " ( " Mr . Clean " in Spanish ) by the press and others .
