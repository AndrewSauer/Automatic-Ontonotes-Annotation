Eric Henry Monkkonen ( August 17 , 1942 in Kansas City , Missouri â€“ May 30 , 2005 in Culver City , California ) was an American urban and social science historian who conducted authoritative studies on the history of crime as well as urban development . 

His work produced evidence that countered and overturned many assumptions , such as that crime rates are higher in urban areas , and increased during post - war periods and economic downturns . 

His works on the history of crime in several cities were extensive , cataloging close to every recorded homicide in New York City since 1798 , and every homicide in Los Angeles since 1827 , and conducting extensive studies on several more cities , primarily in the Western world . 

At one time he believed that murder was largely " a problem of men " , and that " If men take charge of anything ... it must be of the notion that real men do n't kill , that self - respect means shrugging off an insult , and that the better manliness accrues to him who does not fight . 

Other countries have done this , and so can the United States . "
