" Ka ' du se hva ' jeg sa ' ? " 

( " Can you see , ( that 's ) what I told you ? 

" , literally : " Do you see what I said ? " ) 

was the Danish entry in the Eurovision Song Contest 1988 , performed in Danish by Kirsten & Søren ( a duo who had previously entered as Hot Eyes ) . 

The song was performed thirteenth on the night , following Austria 's Wilfried with " Lisa Mona Lisa " and preceding Greece 's Afroditi Frida with " Clown " . 

At the close of voting , it had received 92 points , placing 3rd in a field of 21 . 

The song describes a particularly difficult personality type — who " knows everything for certain " and " whistles if it turns out you 're at fault " . 

Over the course of the song , this person is gradually revealed to be the person to whom the song is being sung in the first place . 

The performance is perhaps more memorable for the fact that the female half of the duo ( Kirsten Siggard ) was heavily pregnant at the time and would give birth only three weeks after the contest . 

It was succeeded as Danish representative at the 1989 Contest by Birthe Kjær with " Vi maler byen rød " .
