The March for Women 's Lives was a demonstration held on April 25 , 2004 on the National Mall in Washington , D.C. protesting the Partial - Birth Abortion Ban Act and other restrictions on abortion . 

March organizers estimated that 1.15 million people participated , declaring it " the largest protest in U.S. history " ; others estimated no more than 800,000 marchers , with the Associated Press and the BBC putting the figure between 500,000 and 800,000 , comparable to the Million Man March of 1995 . 

( The National Park Service no longer makes official estimates of attendance after the Million Man March controversy in 1994 , so estimates are unofficial and may be speculative . ) 

Participants protested the recently passed Partial - Birth Abortion Ban Act ( 2003 ) as well as other policies they claim to be " anti - women " . 

Pro - life protesters were present in some places along the march route . 

There were no violent incidents , despite Washington Post reporter Hank Steuver referring to it as " aggressive and even occasionally , almost delightfully , profane . "
