The First Baptist Church of Tarrytown is located on South Broadway ( U.S. Route 9 ) in Tarrytown , New York , United States . 

It is a stone building in the Victorian Gothic architectural style dating to the 1870s . 

In 1983 it and its rectory were listed on the National Register of Historic Places . 

Congregants first met in the 1840s . 

The first church on the present site was erected in 1847 . 

A quarter - century later Russell Sturgis was commissioned to design the present structure , which took five years to complete , including a detailed Gothic interior . 

It signaled Tarrytown 's development as a suburb , especially after John D. Rockefeller and members of his family moved to the village and joined the church . 

They made possible some of its later enhancements , such as its landscaping and rectory , both added later .
