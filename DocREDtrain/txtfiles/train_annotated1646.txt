Yellowtail Dam is a dam across the Bighorn River in south central Montana in the United States . 

The mid-1960s era concrete arch dam serves to regulate the flow of the Bighorn for irrigation purposes and to generate hydroelectric power . 

The dam and its reservoir , Bighorn Lake , are owned by the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation . 

The project was the result of negotiations between the federal government and the Crow Nation , the tribe of Native Americans that lived on the surrounding Crow Indian Reservation , and was originally envisioned as a shared facility that would provide profits for both sides . 

Eventually , the land was sold to Reclamation , although much of the reservoir , which extends upstream into Wyoming , lies in the reservation . 

The dam was authorized in 1944 and groundbreaking was in 1961 ; it was completed in 1967 after six years of construction . 

Today aside from its original purposes the dam serves for recreation both above and below the structure . 

Regulation of the Bighorn provided by the Yellowtail Dam has transformed the lower river into one of Montana 's premier trout streams . 

However , there has been significant controversy surrounding the allocation of water in the reservoir between Montana and Wyoming , and the ecological damage wrought on of river both above and below the dam .
