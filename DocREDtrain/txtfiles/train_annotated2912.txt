Ljubljana Town Hall ( , also known as or simply or ) is the town hall in Ljubljana , the capital of Slovenia , is the seat of the City Municipality of Ljubljana . 

It is located at Town Square in the city centre close to Ljubljana Cathedral . 

The original building was built in a Gothic style in 1484 , probably according to plans by the Carniolan builder Peter Bezlaj . 

Between 1717 and 1719 , the building underwent a Baroque renovation with a Venetian inspiration by the builder Gregor Maček , Sr . , who built based on plans by the Italian architect Carlo Martinuzzi and on his own plans ( the gable front , the loggia , and the three - part staircase ) . 

In the mid-1920s , a monument to the Serbian and first Yugoslav king Peter I was erected in the entrance of Town Hall . 

The monument , designed by the architect Jože Plečnik , was removed and destroyed by the Fascist Italian occupation authorities of the Province of Ljubljana in April 1941 . 

Outside the town hall stands a replica of the Baroque Robba Fountain , work of Francesco Robba . 

The original work , finished in 1751 , is kept in the National Gallery .
