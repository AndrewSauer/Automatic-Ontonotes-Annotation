Mind Changer is a 1998 science fiction book by Northern Irish author James White , part of his Sector General series . 

Publishers Weekly described Mind Changer as " White 's finest performance , replete with wit , originality , medical expertise and sheer decency " and commented that the series shows no signs of aging , and Booklist described the book as an " enjoyable , witty resum√© " of Chief Psychologist O'Mara 's career . 

Todd Richmond wrote that the Sector General series declined after Star Healer ( 1985 ) , hitting a low point with The Galactic Gourmet ( 1996 ) , and that the later books tended to stretch a short story 's worth of content to the length of a novel . 

However he thought that Mind Changer ( 1998 ) represented an improvement .
