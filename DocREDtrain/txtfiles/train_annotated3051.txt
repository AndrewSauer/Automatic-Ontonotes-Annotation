The Battle of Naseby was a decisive engagement of the English Civil War , fought on 14 June 1645 between the main Royalist army of King Charles I and the Parliamentarian New Model Army , commanded by Sir Thomas Fairfax and Oliver Cromwell . 

It was fought near the village of Naseby in Northamptonshire . 

After the Royalists stormed the Parliamentarian town of Leicester on 31st May 1645 , Fairfax was ordered to lift his siege of Oxford , the Royalist capital , and engage the King 's main army . 

Eager to bring the Royalists to battle , Fairfax set off in pursuit of the Royalist army , which was heading to recover the north . 

The King , faced with retreating north with Fairfax close behind , or giving battle , decided to give battle , fearing a loss of morale if his army continued retreating . 

After hard fighting , the Parliamentarian army had all but destroyed the Royalist force , which suffered 7,000 casualties out of 7,400 effectives . 

Charles lost the bulk of his veteran infantry and officers , all of his artillery and stores , his personal baggage and many arms , ensuring the Royalists would never again field an army of comparable quality . 

Captured in the baggage train were the King 's private papers , revealing to the fullest extent his attempts to draw Irish Catholics and foreign mercenaries into the war . 

Publication of these papers gave Parliament an added moral cause in fighting the war to a finish . 

Within a year , Parliament had won the first civil war .
