Technique is the fifth studio album by English rock band New Order , released on 30 January 1989 by Factory Records . 

Partly recorded on the island of Ibiza , it incorporates Balearic beat and acid house influences into the group 's dance - rock sound . 

The album was influenced by the then growing acid scene , and Sumner 's experiences in the 500 Club in New York and Shroom in London . 

It was the first in a few of their albums where Peter Hook 's bass sound was predominant . 

Technique was also New Order 's final studio album to be released under Factory Records ( though not their final Factory release , that being the following year 's " World in Motion " ) ; the label would declare bankruptcy in 1992 following a severe financial downturn caused primarily by the significant commercial failure of Happy Mondays ' Yes Please ! 

Technique was the first New Order album to reach number one on the UK charts , and " Fine Time " , the first single from the album , reached number 11 . 

Remixed versions of " Round & Round " and " Run " were also released as singles .
