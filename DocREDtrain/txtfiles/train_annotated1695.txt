Facts and Arguments for Darwin is an 1864 book on evolutionary biology by the German biologist Fritz Müller , originally published in German under the title ( " For Darwin " ) , and translated into English by William Sweetland Dallas in 1867 . 

Müller argued that Charles Darwin 's theory of evolution by natural selection that he had advanced in his book The Origin of Species only five years earlier was correct , citing evidence that he had come across in Brazil . 

Müller states in the ' Author 's Preface ' : 

“ It is not the purpose of the following pages to discuss once more the arguments deduced for and against Darwin 's theory of the origin of species , or to weigh them one against the other . 

Their object is simply to indicate a few facts favourable to this theory , collected upon the same South American ground , on which , as Darwin tells us , the idea first occurred to him of devoting his attention to ‘ the origin of species , — that mystery of mysteries’ . 

“ It is only by the accumulation of new and valuable material that the controversy will gradually be brought into a state fit for final decision , and this appears to be for the present of more importance than a repeated analysis of what is already before us . 

Moreover , it is but fair to leave it to Darwin himself at first to beat off the attacks of his opponents from the splendid structure which he has raised with such a master - hand . ”
