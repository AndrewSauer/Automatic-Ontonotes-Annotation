" Millennium " is a song by English singer Robbie Williams from his 1998 album I 've Been Expecting You . 

In September 1998 , it was released as the album 's first track which became Williams ' first single to top the UK Singles Chart . 

The song also received extensive airplay in the United States and Canada , where it was the lead single from Williams ' 1999 compilation album , The Ego Has Landed . 

The song borrows heavily from the musical arrangement of John Barry 's " You Only Live Twice " , the title track of the 1967 James Bond film of the same name , said to be one of Williams ' favourite James Bond movies . 

However , it is a re - recording in a slightly different key instead of a direct sample for reasons of cost .
