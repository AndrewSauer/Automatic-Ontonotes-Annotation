The Gordon Riots of 1780 was a massive anti - Catholic protest in London against the Papists Act of 1778 , which was intended to reduce official discrimination against British Catholics . 

Lord George Gordon , head of the Protestant Association warned that the law would enable Catholics in the British Army to become a dangerous threat . 

The protest evolved into riots and widespread looting . 

Local magistrates were afraid of reprisals and did not issue the riot act . 

There was no repression until the Army finally moved in and started shooting . 

The main violence lasted from 2 June to 9 June , 1780 . 

The Popery Act 1698 had imposed a number of penalties and disabilities on Roman Catholics in England ; the 1778 Act eliminated some of these . 

An initial peaceful protest led on to widespread rioting and looting and was the most destructive in the history of London . 

Painted on the wall of Newgate prison was the proclamation that the inmates had been freed by the authority of " His Majesty , King Mob " . 

The term " King Mob " afterwards denoted an unruly and fearsome proletariat . 

The Riots came at the height of the American War of Independence , when Britain , with no large ally , was fighting American rebels , France , Spain , and the Dutch Republic . 

Public opinion , especially in middle - class and elite circles , repudiated anti - Catholicism and lower - class violence , and rallied behind Lord North 's government . 

Demands were made for a London police force .
