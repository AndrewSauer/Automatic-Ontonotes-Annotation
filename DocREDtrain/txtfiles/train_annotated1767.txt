The Arikaree Breaks are badlands in northwest Kansas . 

They form a two - to - three - mile - wide break of rough terrain between the plains of northwestern Kansas and eastern Colorado and the south sides of the Arikaree and Republican river basins . 

The breaks extend from Rawlins County , Kansas westward across Cheyenne County , Kansas and into Yuma County , Colorado . 

The Arikaree Breaks were carved by water . 

The soil here called Loess was blown to the area around 10,000 years ago . 

The soil has a tendency to erode , forming nearly vertical cliffs . 

This kind of soil is also found in northeast Kansas , southwest Nebraska , and Iowa . 

The soil in that part of the state forms the Loess Hills .
