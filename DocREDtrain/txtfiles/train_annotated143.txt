Rapid Penang ( styled as rapidPenang ) is a public bus brand in the State of Penang , Malaysia . 

Formed as a subsidiary of Prasarana Malaysia in 2007 , to date it is the main public transport operator within Penang ; its bus network serves commuters within Greater Penang , including the neighbouring towns in Kedah and Perak . 

Rapid Penang was the second public transportation firm established by Prasarana Malaysia , a corporate body owned by the Malaysian federal government to manage urban public transportation . 

The first was Rapid KL in 2004 , which now encompasses public bus , LRT and monorail services within Kuala Lumpur and the greater Klang Valley . 

Thus , similar to Rapid KL , Rapid Penang 's bus fleet is under the management of Rapid Bus Sdn Bhd .
