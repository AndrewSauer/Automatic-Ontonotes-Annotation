Bankikodla - Hanehalli ( Kannada ) ( Yashwant Chittal 's ಹನೇಹಳಎಂಬ ಜಗತ್ತು ) are twin neighbouring villages in a valley in Uttara Kannada district in the south western section of the Indian state of Karnataka . 

Just to the north of the village , the Gangavali River joins the Arabian Sea . 

The town of Gokarna is just to the south of the village . 

The surrounding Sahyadri Mountains hug the Arabian sea with open fields providing recreational opportunities for the locals . 

It has creeks and shallow ponds and bridges , which are vulnerable in the rainy seasons . 

For religious or spiritual people , there are temples , church and a Masjid to worship in . 

During British rule in India , the Chitrapur Saraswat Brahmins built Anandashram High School ( 1884 ) for their children , but a majority of them eventually moved out to Mumbai . 

The younger population is now moving out of the village and the older generations , especially the retired communities , have started coming back to the village .
