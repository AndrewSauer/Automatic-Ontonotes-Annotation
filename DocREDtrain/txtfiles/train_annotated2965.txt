The Sidi Saiyyed Mosque , popularly known as Sidi Saiyyid ni Jali locally , built in 1572 - 73 AD ( Hijri year 980 ) , is one of the most famous mosques of Ahmedabad , Gujarat , India . 

As attested by the marble tablet fixed on the wall of the mosque , it was built by Sidi Saiyyid in the retinue of Bilal Jhajar Khan , general in the army of the last Sultan Shams - ud - Din Muzaffar Shah III of the Gujarat Sultanate . 

The mosque was built in the last year of the existence of Gujarat Sultanate . 

The mosque is entirely arcuated and is known for its ten intricately carved stone latticework windows ( jalis ) on the side and rear arches . 

The rear wall is filled with square stone pierced panels in geometrical designs . 

The two bays flanking the central aisle have reticulated stone slabs carved in designs of intertwined trees and foliage and a palm motif . 

This intricately carved lattice stone window is the Sidi Saiyyed Jali , the unofficial symbol of city of Ahmedabad and the inspiration for the design of the logo of the Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad . 

The central window arch of the mosque , where one would expect to see another intricate jali , is instead walled with stone . 

This is possibly because the mosque was not completed according to plan before the Mughals invaded Gujarat .
