Noah Noble ( January 15 , 1794 â€“ February 8 , 1844 ) was the fifth Governor of the U.S. state of Indiana from 1831 to 1837 . 

His two terms focused largely on internal improvements , culminating in the passage of the Mammoth Internal Improvement Act , which was viewed at the time as his crowning achievement . 

His taxing recommendations to pay for the improvements were not fully enacted , and the project ultimately led the state to negotiate a partial bankruptcy only a few years later . 

The debacle led to a gradual collapse of the state Whig party , which never regained control of the government , and led to a period of Democratic control that lasted until the middle of the American Civil War . 

After his term as governor he was appointed to the Board of Internal Improvement where he unsuccessfully advocated a reorganization of the projects in an attempt to gain some benefit from them .
