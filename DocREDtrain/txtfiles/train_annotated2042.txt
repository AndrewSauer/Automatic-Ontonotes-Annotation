Marissa Nadler ( born April 5 , 1981 ) is an American musician and fine artist based in Boston , Massachusetts . 

Active since 2000 , she is currently signed to Sacred Bones Records and Bella Union , and released her seventh full - length studio album , Strangers , in May 2016 . 

As a singer - songwriter , her music defies simple classification . 

Her work " is rooted in old - school country and folk but brings in elements of experimental and black metal " . 

Sometimes the term " dream folk " has been invoked to describe her work . 

Singing in a mezzo - soprano , Nadler has received acclaim for her vocals . 

Her voice was described by Pitchfork as one " you would follow straight into Hades " , and also " textured and angelic , with just a hint of pain captured within her iridescent falsetto " . 

The Boston Globe said , " She has a voice that , in mythological times , could have lured men to their deaths at sea , an intoxicating soprano drenched in gauzy reverb that hits bell - clear heights , lingers , and tapers off like rings of smoke " .
