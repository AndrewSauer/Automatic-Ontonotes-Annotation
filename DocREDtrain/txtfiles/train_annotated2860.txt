Auburn was an unincorporated community in rural Baker County , Oregon , United States , now considered a ghost town . 

Auburn lies off Oregon Route 7 southwest of Baker City and east of McEwen on the edge of the Blue Mountains . 

Auburn is deserted today , but the former gold mining boomtown was once the largest community in Eastern Oregon . 

Auburn only had one or two buildings until 1861 , when gold was discovered in the area . 

By September 1862 , Auburn had grown into a full - fledged town with over 20 stores and 1000 homes to serve the mining industry . 

In that month the Oregon Legislative Assembly made Auburn the first county seat of Baker County , but by the 1870s Auburn was largely deserted , with a population of 200 people in 1873 . 

The post office , the first in northeast Oregon , closed in 1903 . 

It had opened on November 1 , 1862 , with William F. McCrary as the first postmaster .
