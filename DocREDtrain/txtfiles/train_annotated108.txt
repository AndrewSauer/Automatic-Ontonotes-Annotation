Stampede Pass ( elevation ) is a mountain pass in the northwest United States , through the Cascade Range in Washington . 

Southeast of Seattle and east of Tacoma , its importance to transportation lies almost entirely with railroading , as no paved roads cross it . 

It is approximately south - southeast of Snoqualmie Pass , the gap for and south of Keechelus Lake . 

The pass , and the tunnel to the south which takes advantage of it , the Stampede Tunnel ( ) , just below played a significant role in the history of the Northern Pacific Railway . 

The tunnel opened for service in May 1888 , and is currently operated by the NP 's successor , BNSF Railway . 

After over a decade of dormancy in the late 20th century , the Stampede Pass Line and Tunnel were reopened in 1997 by BNSF , which utilizes the route as one of two direct Northern Transcon main lines through the Cascades , between Spokane and the Seattle metropolitan area .
