" Himnusz " (; ) is the national anthem of Hungary . 

It was adopted in the 19th century and the first stanza is sung at official ceremonies . 

The words were written by Ferenc Kölcsey , a nationally renowned poet , in 1823 , and its currently official musical setting was composed by the romantic composer Ferenc Erkel in 1844 , although other less - known musical versions exist . 

The poem bore the subtitle " A magyar nép zivataros századaiból " ( " From the stormy centuries of the Hungarian people " ) ; it is often argued that this subtitle – by emphasising past rather than contemporary national troubles – was added expressly to enable the poem to pass Habsburg censorship . 

The full meaning of the poem 's text is evident only to those well acquainted with Hungarian history . 

The lyrics of " Himnusz " are a prayer beginning with the words Isten , áldd meg a magyart ( ) ( ) .
