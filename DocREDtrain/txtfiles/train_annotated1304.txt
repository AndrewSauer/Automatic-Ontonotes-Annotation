In Sumerian religion , Ninlil ( 𒀭𒊩𒌆𒆤 NIN.LÍL"lady of the open field " or " Lady of the Wind " ) , also called Sud , in Assyrian called Mulliltu , is the consort goddess of Enlil . 

Her parentage is variously described . 

Most commonly she is called the daughter of Haia ( god of stores ) and Nunbarsegunu ( or Ninshebargunnu [ a goddess of barley ] or Nisaba ) . 

Another Akkadian source says she is the daughter of Anu ( a.k.a . 

An ) and Antu ( Sumerian Ki ) . 

Other sources call her a daughter of Anu and Nammu . 

She lived in Dilmun with her family . 

Impregnated by her husband Enlil , who lie with her by the water , she conceived a boy , Nanna / Suen , the future moon god . 

As punishment Enlil was dispatched to the underworld kingdom of Ereshkigal , where Ninlil joined him . 

Enlil impregnated her disguised as the gatekeeper , where upon she gave birth to their son Nergal , god of death . 

In a similar manner she conceived the underworld god Ninazu when Enlil impregnated her disguised as the man of the river of the nether world , a man - devouring river . 

Later Enlil disguised himself as the man of the boat , impregnating her with a fourth deity Enbilulu , god of rivers and canals . 

All of these act as substitutes for Nanna / Suen to ascend . 

In some texts Ninlil is also the mother of Ninurta , the heroic god who slew Asag the demon with his mace , Sharur . 

After her death , she became the goddess of the wind , like Enlil . 

She may be the Goddess of the South Wind referred to in the story of Adapa , as her husband Enlil was associated with northerly winter storms . 

As " Lady Wind " she may be associated with the figure of the Akkadian demon " Lil - itu " , thought to have been the origin of the Hebrew Lilith legend .
