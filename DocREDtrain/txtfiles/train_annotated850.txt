Princess Diana 's Revenge is a novel written by the English writer Michael de Larrabeiti and self - published in 2006 , under the imprint " Tallis House " , which is the name used by de Larrabeiti for publishing his own works . 

In the context of de Larrabeiti 's other works , it is perhaps closest in tone to his thrillers The Bunce and The Hollywood Takes , dealing with conspiracy theories and partly featuring the documentary film business in which de Larrabeiti 's earlier novels were set . 

Despite de Larrabeiti being an established author of thirty years ' standing , Princess Diana 's Revenge was turned down by his literary agents , Curtis Brown . 

The novel was then turned down by over thirty publishers in the United Kingdom . 

In response to this de Larrabeiti decided to self - publish under his own imprint , " Tallis House " . 

He is one of the first established authors to self - publish , along with the Canadian writer Jim Munroe . 

The book tells the story of Joe Rapps , a director and cameraman who slips into the surreal world of Milton Magna , an Oxfordshire village which is based on the real village of Great Milton where de Larrabeiti lived for over thirty years . 

Rapps is drawn into various conspiracy theories revolving around the Friends of Diana , a cult which has grown up around the memory of Diana , Princess of Wales , and is determined to avenge her death in a car crash in Paris on 31 August 1997 . 

Although the book is not as explicitly anti - authoritarian as de Larrabeiti 's most famous work , The Borrible Trilogy , its satire of members of the royal family ensure that the book is run - through with the anti - authoritarianism that is present in all of de Larrabeiti 's work .
