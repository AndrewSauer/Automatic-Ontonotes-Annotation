The PPG tankette ( , literally " mobile machine - gun nest " ) , also known by the prototype name Obiekt 217 , was a Soviet tankette produced for fighting in Finland . 

This vehicle never saw combat . 

Soviet infantry took huge losses attacking Finnish fortifications in the Winter War . 

To compensate , they sometimes assaulted them in armoured sledges towed by tanks . 

The PPG tankette was an attempt to create an infantry carrier to fulfil this role . 

About a hundred were produced at the Kirov Factory in Leningrad in 1940 and rushed to the front , but did n't make it to Finland in time to be used in combat . 

The PPG tankette had partial armoured cover of 5 to 8   mm thickness protecting the front and sides , for two infantrymen riding in a prone position . 

It was armed with two 7.62 mm DT machine guns with 1,575 rounds . 

The tankette was powered by a engine PMZ two - stroke , 2-cylinder , liquid cooled petrol engine of 16 hp allowing it to reach a speed of about 18   km / h on and 7 km/h off roads while weighed 1.73 tonnes .
