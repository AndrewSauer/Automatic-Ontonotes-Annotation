Zhuge Shang ( died 263 ) was a military officer of the state of Shu Han in the Three Kingdoms period of China . 

He was the eldest son of the Shu general Zhuge Zhan and a grandson of Zhuge Liang , the first Chancellor of Shu . 

In 263 , Deng Ai , a general from Shu 's rival state Cao Wei , led an army to attack Shu and showed up in Fu ( 涪 ; in present - day Mianyang , Sichuan ) after taking a shortcut from Yinping ( 陰平 ; present - day Wen County , Longnan , Gansu ) . 

Zhuge Zhan led the Shu forces to Fu to resist the enemy but retreated to Mianzhu ( 緜竹 ) when he heard that the Shu vanguard had been defeated . 

Deng Ai sent a messenger to ask Zhuge Zhan to surrender , but Zhuge refused and executed the messenger . 

In the ensuing battle at Mianzhu , the Shu forces were defeated and both Zhuge Zhan and Zhuge Shang were killed in action . 

Before joining his father in battle , Zhuge Shang sighed , " My father and I received grace from the State . 

Our failure to eliminate Huang Hao earlier on resulted in our State being stuck in this disastrous situation now . 

What can we do with our lives ? "
