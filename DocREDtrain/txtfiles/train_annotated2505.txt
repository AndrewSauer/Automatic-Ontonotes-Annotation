City of Indianapolis v. Edmond , 531 U.S. 32 ( 2000 ) , was a case in which the Supreme Court of the United States limited the power of law enforcement to conduct suspicionless searches , specifically , using drug - sniffing dogs at roadblocks . 

Previous Supreme Court decisions had given the police power to create roadblocks for the purposes of border security ( United States v. Martinez - Fuerte ) , and removing drunk drivers from the road ( Michigan Dept . 

of State Police v. Sitz ) . 

This decision stated that the power was limited to situations in which the search was " designed to serve special needs , beyond the normal need for law enforcement . " 

The Court drew a line on check point programs that followed Police v. Sitz ( 1990 ) " whose primary purpose " is " to detect evidence of ordinary criminal wrongdoing " . 

The Court refused to " credit the ' general interest in crime control ' as justification for a regime of suspicionless stops . " 

The opinion was delivered by Justice O'Connor , joined by Justices Stevens , Kennedy , Souter , Ginsburg , and Breyer . 

Chief Justice Rehnquist delivered a dissenting opinion , in which Justice Thomas joined , and Justice Scalia joined as to part I. 

Justice Thomas also filed a separate dissent .
