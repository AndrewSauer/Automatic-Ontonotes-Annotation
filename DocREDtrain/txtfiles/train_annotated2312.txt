Nicholas Sergeyevitch Timasheff ( ) ( November 9 , 1886 â€“ March 9 , 1970 ) was a Russian sociologist , professor of jurisprudence and writer . 

Timasheff " came from an old family of Russian nobility " ; his father was Minister of Trade and Industry under Nicholas II . 

In St. Petersburg , where he was born , he attended a classical high school ; he went on to attend the Tsarskoye Selo Lyceum , the University of Strasbourg , and the Saint Petersburg State University ( MA 1910 , LLD 1914 ) . 

At the latter university he met the Polish - Russian jurist Leon Petrazycki , who was a significant influence on him throughout his life . 

Two years later he began teaching sociological jurisprudence at the University of Petrograd . 

He emigrated to the United States following an alleged involvement with the in 1920 . 

He took up a similar position at Fordham University , and was one of the original developers of the discipline of sociology of law . 

Timasheff was the author of various works , including The Great Retreat : The Growth and Decline of Communism in Russia ( New York , 1946 ) , in which he argued that the Bolsheviks made a conscious retreat from socialist values during the 1930s , instead returning to traditional ones like patriotism and the family . 

Historian Terry Martin considers this a misnomer , because " in the political and economic spheres , the period after 1933 marked a consolidation , rather than a repudiation , of the most important goals of Stalin 's socialist offensive : forced industrialization , collectivization , nationalization , abolition of the market , political dictatorship .
