Women 's March on Seattle , also referred to as the Womxn 's March in Seattle or Women 's March in Seattle , was the Seattle affiliate of the worldwide 2017 Women 's March protest on January 21 , 2017 . 

Newspapers including The Seattle Times said it was Seattle 's largest protest march in history . 

The march route was from Seattle 's Central District through Westlake Park in Downtown Seattle to the Seattle Center . 

Drawing an estimated 120,000 to 175,000 marchers according to police and organizers respectively , more than the 1999 Seattle WTO protests , the March filled the entire route through downtown by early afternoon , making vehicle traffic across the route impossible . 

It was expected to be the third largest protest march in the United States on January 21 , after the Women 's March on Washington ( D.C. ) and the march in Los Angeles . 

An unusual feature of the march is that it was planned to be held in silence . 

The event was named using the intentional misspelling " womxn " ; organizers stated that this naming was meant to symbolize intersectionality with the transgender community .
