Cingulata , part of the superorder Xenarthra , is an order of armored New World placental mammals . 

Dasypodids and chlamyphorids , the armadillos , are the only surviving families in the order . 

Two groups of cingulates much larger than extant armadillos ( maximum body mass of 45   kg ( 100   lb ) in the case of the giant armadillo ) existed until recently : pampatheriids , which reached weights of up to 200   kg ( 440   lb ) and chlamyphorid glyptodonts , which attained masses of 2,000   kg ( 4,400   lb ) or more . 

The cingulate order originated in South America during the Paleocene epoch , and due to the continent 's former isolation remained confined to it during most of the Cenozoic . 

However , the formation of a land bridge allowed members of all three families to migrate to southern North America during the Pliocene or early Pleistocene as part of the Great American Interchange . 

After surviving for tens of millions of years , all of the pampatheriids and giant glyptodonts apparently died out during the Quaternary extinction event at the beginning of the Holocene , along with much of the rest of the regional megafauna , shortly after the colonization of the Americas by Paleo - Indians .
