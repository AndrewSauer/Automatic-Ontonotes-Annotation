The Rockwell City Bridge is located just east of Rockwell City , Iowa , United States . 

The span carried traffic on 270th Street over an unnamed stream . 

In 1915 Calhoun County requested the Iowa State Highway Commission ( ISHC ) and Des Moines engineer James B. Marsh to design a bridge for this crossing . 

The ISHC designed a double span concrete girder structure , while Marsh submitted his patented single - span rainbow arch configuration . 

They chose the Marsh submission , and contracted with the Iowa Bridge Company to build six bridges for $ 11,690 , which included the costs for this bridge at $ 4,107.65 . 

Originally built to serve a county road , it was later incorporated into the route for U.S. Highway 20 and carried heavy traffic until the highway was realigned in 1981 . 

While no longer in use , the bridge remains in place just south of the replacement span . 

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1998 .
