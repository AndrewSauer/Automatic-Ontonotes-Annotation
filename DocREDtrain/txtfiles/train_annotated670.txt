The Korea Vision Party ( , Gungmin Saenggak , " National Thought " ) , more commonly known as the K Party , is a center - rightist political party in South Korea . 

It was founded on 12 February 2012 by Park Se - il , president of the Hansun Foundation , a conservative think tank . 

There are concerns that the K Party will split the conservative vote , though Park Se - il met with Saenuri leader Park Geun - hye on 23 February , with Park Geun - hye commenting that " If a party holds the same values and orientation , we are open to partnering " . 

The party aims to field over 200 candidates in the April elections , favoring the selection of women and younger politicians . 

In an opinion poll conducted on 24â€“25 February 2012 , the K Party received a support level of 1.4 % , out - ranking the more established New Progressive Party . 

Analysts have nonetheless raised questions over the ability of the party to secure seats , even if sitting Assembly members do defect . 

The party has attempted to court defecting members of the larger Saenuri Party in the run - up to the 2012 Assembly elections , with a particular focus on loyalists of Lee Myung - bak who have been alienated by the rise of Park Geun - hye . 

Commentators have speculated that pro - Lee lawmakers such as Lee Jae - oh may defect to the K Party en masse , and on March 9 , 2012 , the former Saenuri Party politician Jeon Yeo - ok defected to the K Party and became its first lawmaker .
