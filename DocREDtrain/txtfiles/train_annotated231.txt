Before Manchester City Football Club moved into their first permanent home in Manchester , England , in 1887 , the club played at a short series of grounds which ranged from established cricket venues to bumpy fields with no stands or boundaries nor history of sporting usage . 

The club was founded as a philanthropic endeavour to encourage impressionable youths to commit to wholesome activities rather than falling to the local adolescent culture of alcohol and violence . 

The sport of football was barely 15 years from the writing of its own rulebook . 

The club had no immediate option of using or constructing a stadium , and thus most of their first locations were nothing more than painted lines and goalposts . 

As the club reformed and changed its name twice between 1880 and 1887 , soits choice of locations were a series of low - cost , short - term solutions when their current location became untenable . 

In 1887 , when City moved to their sixth pitch in only eight years , they had the money , ambition , reputation and stability to construct themselves a more permanent base of operations , at the stadium named Hyde Road .
