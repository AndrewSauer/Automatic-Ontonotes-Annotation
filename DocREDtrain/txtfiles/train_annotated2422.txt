The Famatinian orogeny ( ) is an orogeny that predates the rise of the Andes and that took place in what is now western South America during the Paleozoic , leading to the formation of the Famatinian orogen also known as the Famatinian belt . 

The Famatinian orogeny lasted from the Late Cambrian to at least the Late Devonian and possibly the Early Carboniferous , with orogenic activity peaking about 490 to 460 million years ago . 

The orogeny involved metamorphism and deformation in the crust and the eruption and intrusion of magma along a Famatinian magmatic arc that formed a chain of volcanos . 

The igneous rocks of the Famatinian magmatic arc are of calc - alkaline character and include gabbros , tonalites and granodiorites . 

The youngest igneous rocks of the arc are granites . 

The relationship of the orogeny with the Achala and Cerro Aspero batholiths of central Argentina is not fully understood . 

These Devonian batholiths are possibly of post - orogenic character .
