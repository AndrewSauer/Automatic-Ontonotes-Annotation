Catacol ( ) is a small village on the Isle of Arran , Scotland . 

It is located on the north west side of the island , just a few miles along the coastal road from Lochranza at the foot of Glen Catacol , a steep - sided valley . 

It derives its name from Old Norse , referring to the ' gully of the cat ' . 

Catacol 's main feature is the row of cottages called the ' Twelve Apostles ' . 

They were built to house those people cleared from the surrounding countryside , when much of the interior of the island was set aside for deer . 

The theory was these former farmers would turn to fishing , and with this in mind , each of the twelve cottages had a differently shaped first floor window . 

This would allow the woman of the house to signal by placing a candle in the window to her husband while he was out fishing in the Firth of Clyde . 

The husband would know who was being signalled by the shape of the window . 

In reality , most of the dispossessed moved away to other parts of the island in protest against their eviction . 

The village formerly housed a hotel , the , which permanently closed in September 2018 .
