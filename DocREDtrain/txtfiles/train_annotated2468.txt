The Iberian worm lizard or European worm lizard ( Blanus cinereus ) is a species of reptile in the family Blanidae ( worm lizards ) of the clade Amphisbaenia . 

There are 130 species of amphisbaenians , most found in Spain , Africa , South Africa , and the Caribbean islands . 

The Iberian worm lizard is locally known as cobra - cega ( Portuguese ) , culebrilla ciega ( Spanish ) , and colobreta cega ( Catalan ) , all meaning " blind snake " . 

Recent studies into the mitochondrial and nuclear genomic data of 47 isolated B. cinereus populations show rather large sequence divergence between two apparent clades , leading some researchers to call for a division of the Iberian worm lizard into two species . 

While little is known of B. cinereus in comparison with some other reptile species , new insight is growing about this primitive , ancestral reptile .
