The municipal flag of Jerusalem is based on the flag of Israel . 

It features two horizontal blue stripes reminiscent of the tallit ( the Jewish prayer shawl ) . 

In the center are Jerusalem 's municipal emblem , which consists of a shield with the lion of Judah superimposed on a stylized background representing the kotel , flanked on either side with olive branches . 

The word ( i.e. , Yerushalayim , Hebrew for " Jerusalem " ) appears above the shield . 

A vertical variant is sometimes used during ceremonial functions . 

The flag was adopted in 1949 following a contest held by the municipal government of Jerusalem , which was established by Israel ( in the western part of the city ) . 

It was made the " flag of a united Jerusalem " following the Six - Day War in 1967 .
