The House of York was a cadet branch of the English royal House of Plantagenet . 

Three of its members became Kings of England in the late 15th century . 

The House of York was descended in the male line from Edmund of Langley , 1st Duke of York , the fourth surviving son of Edward III , but also represented Edward 's senior line , being cognatic descendants of Lionel , Duke of Clarence , Edward III 's second surviving son . 

It is based on these descents that they claimed the English crown . 

Compared with the House of Lancaster , it had a senior claim to the throne of England according to cognatic primogeniture but junior claim according to the agnatic primogeniture . 

The reign of this dynasty ended with the death of Richard III of England at the Battle of Bosworth Field in 1485 . 

It became extinct in the male line with the death of Edward Plantagenet , 17th Earl of Warwick in 1499 .
