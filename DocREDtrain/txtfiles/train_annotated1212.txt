The Gospel riots ( , Evangelika ) , which took place on the streets of Athens in November 1901 , were primarily a protest against the publication in the newspaper Akropolis of a translation into modern spoken Greek of the gospel of St Matthew , although other motives also played a part . 

The disorder reached a climax on 8 November , " Black Thursday " , when eight demonstrators were killed . 

In the aftermath of the violence the Greek Orthodox Church reacted by banning any translation of the Bible into any form of modern demotic Greek , and by forbidding the employment of demoticist teachers , not just in Greece but anywhere in the Ottoman Empire . 

The Riots marked a turning - point in the history of the Greek language question , and the beginning of a long period of bitter antagonism between the Orthodox Church and the demoticist movement .
