Peace Sells ... but Who 's Buying ? 

is the second studio album by American thrash metal band Megadeth , released on September 19 , 1986 by Capitol Records . 

The project was originally handled by Combat Records , resulting in the original mix of the album being co - produced by Randy Burns . 

Capitol Records then bought the rights to the album and hired another producer named Paul Lani to mix it himself . 

The recording of the album was difficult for the band , because of the ongoing drug issues the members had at the time . 

Drummer Gar Samuelson and guitarist Chris Poland were fired shortly after the album 's promotional tour for drug abuse making it the last Megadeth album for Samuelson before his death and the last for Poland until he reappeared as a session musician on The System Has Failed . 

The title track , noted for its politically conscious lyrics , was released as the album 's lead single . 

The album 's cover art , featuring the band 's mascot Vic Rattlehead in front of a desolated United Nations Headquarters , was created by Ed Repka .
