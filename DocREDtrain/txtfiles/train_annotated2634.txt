Vagn Walfrid Ekman ( 3 May 1874 – 9 March 1954 ) was a Swedish oceanographer . 

Born in Stockholm to Fredrik Laurentz Ekman , himself an oceanographer , he became committed to oceanography while studying physics at the University of Uppsala and , in particular , on hearing Vilhelm Bjerknes lecture on fluid dynamics . 

During the expedition of the Fram , Fridtjof Nansen had observed that icebergs tend to drift not in the direction of the prevailing wind but at an angle of 20 ° -40 ° to the right . 

Bjerknes invited Ekman , still a student , to investigate the problem and , in 1905 , Ekman published his theory of the Ekman spiral which explains the phenomenon in terms of the balance between frictional effects in the ocean and the Coriolis force , which arises from moving objects in a rotating environment , like planetary rotation . 

On completing his doctorate in Uppsala in 1902 , Ekman joined the International Laboratory for Oceanographic Research , Oslo where he worked for seven years , not only extending his theoretical work but also developing experimental techniques and instruments such as the Ekman current meter and Ekman water bottle . 

From 1910 to 1939 he continued his theoretical and experimental work at the University of Lund , where he was professor of mechanics and mathematical physics . 

He was elected a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in 1935 . 

A gifted amateur bass singer , pianist , and composer , he continued working right up to his death in Gostad , near Stockaryd , Sweden .
