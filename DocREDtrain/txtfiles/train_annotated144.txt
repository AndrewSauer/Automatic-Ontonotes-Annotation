Alexis - Emmanuel Chabrier (; 18 January 184113 September 1894 ) was a Romantic composer and pianist , born in Ambert , central France . 

His bourgeois family did not approve of a musical career for him , and his studies at law school in Paris to the age of thirty - nine he worked as a civil servant , while immersing himself in the modernist artistic life of the French capital , and composing in his spare time . 

From 1880 until his final illness he was a full - time composer . 

Although known primarily for two of his orchestral works , España and Joyeuse marche , Chabrier left a corpus of operas ( including L'étoile ) , songs , and piano music , but no symphonies , concertos , quartets , sonatas , or religious or liturgical music . 

His lack of academic training left him free to create his own musical language , unaffected by established rules , and he was regarded by many later composers as an important innovator . 

He was admired by , and influenced , composers as diverse as Debussy , Ravel , Richard Strauss , Satie , Stravinsky , and the group of composers known as Les six . 

Writing at a time when French musicians were generally proponents or opponents of the music of Wagner , Chabrier steered a middle course , sometimes incorporating Wagnerian traits into his music and at other times avoiding them . 

Chabrier was associated with some of the leading writers and painters of his time . 

Among his closest friends was the painter Édouard Manet , and Chabrier collected Impressionist paintings long before they became fashionable . 

A number of such paintings from his personal collection by artists known to him are now housed in some of the world 's leading art museums . 

He penned a large number of letters to friends and colleagues which offer an insight into his musical opinions and character . 

Chabrier died in Paris at the age of fifty - three from a neurological disease , probably caused by syphilis .
