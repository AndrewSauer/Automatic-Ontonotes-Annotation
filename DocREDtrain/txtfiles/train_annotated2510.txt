The British Army during the American Revolutionary War served for eight years in campaigns fought around the globe . 

Defeat at the Siege of Yorktown to a combined Franco - US force ultimately led to the loss of the Thirteen Colonies in eastern North America , and the concluding Treaty of Paris deprived Britain of many of the gains achieved in the Seven Years ' War . 

However several victories elsewhere meant that much of the British Empire remained intact . 

In 1775 the British Army was a volunteer force . 

The army had suffered from lack of peacetime spending and ineffective recruitment in the decade since the Seven Years ' War , circumstances which had left it in a dilapidated state at the outbreak of war in North America . 

To offset this the British government quickly hired contingents of German mercenaries to serve as auxiliaries alongside the regular army units in campaigns from 1776 . 

Limited army impressment was also introduced in England and Scotland to bolster recruitment in 1778 , however the practice proved too unpopular and was proscribed again in 1780 . 

The attrition of constant fighting , the inability of the Royal Navy to decisively defeat the French Navy , and the withdrawal of the majority of British forces from North America in 1778 ultimately led to the British army 's defeat . 

The surrender of Cornwallis 's army at Yorktown in 1781 allowed the Whig opposition to gain a majority in parliament , and British operations were brought to an end .
