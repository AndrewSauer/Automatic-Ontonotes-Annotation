The old Tower of Galata ( , meaning Great Tower ) was a tower which stood on the north side of the Golden Horn in Constantinople , inside the citadel of Galata . 

The tower marked the northern end of the great chain , which was stretched across the mouth of the Golden Horn to the Tower of Eugenius to prevent enemy ships from entering the harbor . 

The tower contained a mechanism of elevation gears for raising and lowering the chain . 

The tower was largely destroyed by the Latin Crusaders during the Sack of Constantinople in 1204 , part of the Fourth Crusade , enabling them to enter the harbor and attack the city from the sea , where the walls were more easily scaled . 

This tower should not be confused with the present - day Galata Tower , which is still standing . 

The current tower was built by the Genoese in 1348 , on a different site , at the northernmost and highest point of the citadel of Galata . 

The Genoese named the new tower as Christea Turris ( Tower of Christ ) . 

The Byzantines , however , also called this new tower with the name Megalos Pyrgos ( Great Tower ) .
