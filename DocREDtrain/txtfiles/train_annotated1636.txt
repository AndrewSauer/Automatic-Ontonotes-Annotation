" Christmas ( Baby Please Come Home ) " is a rock song originally sung by Darlene Love and included on the 1963 seasonal compilation album , A Christmas Gift for You from Philles Records . 

The song was written by Ellie Greenwich and Jeff Barry ( Phil Spector also is co - credited ) , with the intention of being sung by Ronnie Spector of The Ronettes . 

According to Darlene Love , Ronnie Spector was not able to put as much emotion into the song as needed . 

Instead , Love was brought into the studio to record the song , which became a big success over time and one of her signature tunes . 

Love 's later song , " All Alone on Christmas " , which was used in the 1992 Christmas movie , Home Alone 2 , referenced the song . 

The song as recorded by Love was released as a single in 1963 ( Philles 119 ) and in 1964 ( Philles X-125 ) . 

But the records did not chart in both years . 

In December 2010 , Rolling Stone magazine ranked " Christmas ( Baby Please Come Home ) " first on its list of The Greatest Rock and Roll Christmas Songs , noting that " nobody can match Love 's emotion and sheer vocal power . " 

As an example of the track 's staying power , it reached # 45 on the Billboard Holiday Airplay chart in 2016 .
