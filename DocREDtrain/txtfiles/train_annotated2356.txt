Since Malta 's Independence in 1964 , there has been a rapid increase in buildings all over the country . 

However , most of the urban areas are concentrated around the Grand Harbour and Marsamxett Harbour areas where some of the country 's most busy places are situated ; Sliema , Saint Julian 's , Paceville , Msida , Gżira , Ta ' Xbiex and Pietà . 

As cars and road transport grew more and more popular in the country , the population started to spread out to farther areas and nowadays some other urban areas have developed ; Saint Paul 's Bay ( including Qawra , Buġibba and Xemxija ) and Mellieħa in the North , whilst having Marsaskala and the Malta Freeport area in the South of the country . 

Some of the tall buildings in Malta , such as the Metropolis Plaza in Gżira , are still under construction . 

The highest structure ever built in Malta was the Delimara Power Station chimney , standing above ground , until its demolition in 2017 – 18 . 

The tallest building will be one of the towers at the Metropolis Plaza in Gżira , with 33 storeys .
