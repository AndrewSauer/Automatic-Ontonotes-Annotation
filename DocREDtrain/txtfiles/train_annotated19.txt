Olen ( ) was a legendary early poet from Lycia who went to Delos , where his hymns celebrating the first handmaidens of Apollo in the island of the god 's birth and other " ancient hymns " were still part of the cult at Delos in the time of Herodotus : 

The hieratic poetry of Olen is now entirely lost . 

Pausanias wrote , " The Lycian Olen , an earlier poet , who composed for the Delians , among other hymns , one to Eileithyia , styles her ' the clever spinner ' , clearly identifying her with fate , and makes her older than Cronos . " 

( Description of Greece 8.21.3 ) . 

Apparently Olen 's hymn reflected the pre - Hellenic role of Eileithyia , whom Olympian mythographers like Hesiod recast as a daughter of Zeus and Hera . 

The Delphian Pythia Boeo attributed to him the introduction of the cult of Apollo and the invention of the epic meter . 

Many hymns , nomes ( simple songs to accompany the circular dance of the chorus ) , and oracles , attributed to Olen , were preserved in Delos , revered as Apollo 's birthplace . 

" The legend which was especially attributed to him was that of Apollo 's sojourn among the Hyperboreans . "
