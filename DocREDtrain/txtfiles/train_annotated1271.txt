Begoña or more puristically but also more rarely spelled Begoina , meaning ' the lower foot ' ( of Mount Artxanda ) , is a historical municipality of Biscay ( Basque Country , Spain ) that was incorporated to Bilbao in 1925 . 

Originally it included all the uplands south and east of the medieval walled town , that now form the 2nd , 3rd , 4th and parts of 5th urban districts of Bilbao . 

Nowadays the name is limited to the district including Santutxu , Bolueta and Begoña proper , a small residential neighbourhood between the Basilica and the garden area of Etxebarria Park . 

A notable person with this given name is Begoña Gómez Martín , a Spanish Olympic judoka . 

Due to its association with a church dedicated to Our Lady of Begoña , the name of the neighbourhood is also a popular name of women in the Basque Country ( and also in some other Spanish - speaking areas ) .
