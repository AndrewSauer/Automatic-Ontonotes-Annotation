The Best of the Art of Noise is the name of a series of compilation albums with songs by the British synthpop band The Art of Noise . 

The first version was released on the China Records label in November 1988 . 

The Best of the Art of Noise was released with at least ten different track listing variations from 1988 to 1997 . 

The first version was on LP format and contained 7 " single mixes , while the corresponding compact disc release that year contained the extended or 12 " single remixes of all of the tracks . 

However , LP releases in territories such as Korea and Argentina featured a combination of both track listings . 

A Japanese CD version from 1991 was identical to the standard CD but contained two more mixes of " Kiss " as bonus tracks . 

In 1992 , China Records reissued The Best of and added " Yebo , " " Instruments of Darkness " and " Robinson Crusoe , " while omitting the three tracks that were licensed from ZTT Records and included on the 1988 release : " Beatbox , " " Moments in Love " and " Close ( To the Edit ) . " 

Once again , a number of different variations were issued . 

The United Kingdom and Holland issued a double disc limited edition version with both the standard disc of 7 " mixes and a second disc of extended and 12 " remixes . 

The compilation has also been issued with two different color variations on the cover . 

All editions prior to 1992 were issued with a blue cover , while most editions afterward had a pink cover . 

The German and Australian editions as well as the UK / Holland limited edition two disc set all retained the blue cover .
