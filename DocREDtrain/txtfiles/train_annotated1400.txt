The legend of Billy the Kid has acquired iconic status in American folklore , yet the outlaw himself , also known as William Bonney , had minimal impact on historical events in New Mexico Territory of the late 1800s . 

More has been written about Billy the Kid than any other gunslinger in the history of the American West , while hundreds of books , motion pictures , radio and television programs and even a ballet have been inspired by his legend . 

When he was still alive , " Billy the Kid " had already become a nationally known figure whose exploits , real and imaginary , were reported in the National Police Gazette and the large newspapers of the eastern United States . 

After his death on July 14 , 1881 , all of New York City 's papers ran his obituary , and within days , newspapers around the United States were printing exaggerated and romanticized accounts of Billy the Kid 's short career . 

In the fifteen or so dime novels about his criminal career published between 1881 and 1906 , the Kid was an outlaw antihero , customarily depicted as a badman with superior gunslinging skills , or even as a demonic agent of Satan who delighted in murder .
