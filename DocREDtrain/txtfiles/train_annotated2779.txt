The was a two - ship class of pre - dreadnought battleships built for the Imperial Japanese Navy in the late 1890s . 

As Japan lacked the industrial capacity to build such warships herself , they were designed and built in the UK . 

The ships participated in the Russo - Japanese War of 1904 â€“ 1905 , including the Battle of Port Arthur on the second day of the war . 

Hatsuse sank after striking two mines off Port Arthur in May 1904 . 

Shikishima fought in the Battles of the Yellow Sea and Tsushima and was lightly damaged in the latter action , although shells prematurely exploded in the barrels of her main guns in each battle . 

The ship was reclassified as a coast defence ship in 1921 and served as a training ship for the rest of her career . 

She was disarmed and hulked in 1923 and finally broken up for scrap in 1948 .
