Zemina ( Korean : 재미나 , originally 제미나 ) was a South Korean software maker brand of Saehan Trading ( Korean : 새한 상사 ) founded in 1981 . 

They primarily made games for the Daewoo Zemmix , but because it was an MSX computer made to look and be played like a game console , they work on other MSX computers as well . 

Although many of them were copies of other games , like Super Boy I ( based on Super Mario Bros. ) , they also produced some more original ones in their later years . 

Korea did not have a copyright law for computer programs until July 1987 . 

Because of that , many companies , including Zemina , sold unauthorized copies of foreign titles with their own copyright hacked in . 

Even after that , the new law protected only the program code , not the intellectual property as a whole , so a lot of their " own " games were ports of famous Japanese games . 

Most of their titles were converted to the Sega Master System as well . 

In 1992 , they engaged in developing exclusive games for the Master System and Famicom consoles , but not all of them were released . 

They even released under official license from Konami under the title Salamander II - all the while still selling multi game cartridges full of unlicensed copies of older Konami games .
