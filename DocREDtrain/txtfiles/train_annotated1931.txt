The ODU Monarchs women 's basketball team contributed to the initial rise in popularity of women 's intercollegiate basketball in the United States in the 1970s . 

Women 's college basketball was organized under the auspices of the AIAW in the early 1970s , at a time when competitive power was distributed among small colleges that had established a niche ( such as Immaculata , Delta State , West Chester State , Wayland Baptist and Stephen F. Austin ) . 

Later in the decade , ODU won two national championships in dominating fashion with star players , Nancy Lieberman and Anne Donovan . 

ODU , along with UCLA and Tennessee , among others , led the rise to prominence of large schools with national reputations to the top intercollegiate level , before the NCAA began sponsoring sports for women .
