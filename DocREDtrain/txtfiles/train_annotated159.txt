Pierre Jean " Buster " Martin ( 1 September 1906 ? 

â€“ 12 April 2011 ) claimed to be the United Kingdom 's oldest employee , stating that he was born in 1906 . 

Until his death , Martin worked for Pimlico Plumbers , a well - known plumbing company in southeast London as a van cleaner , and notably refused to take a day off on the day he celebrated what he claimed was his 100th birthday . 

He also received coverage in the media for fending off an attack from a group of youths in 2007 ; his heroics were cited by the former Liberal Democrat leader Sir Menzies Campbell as " living proof of why people should not be written off once they pass retirement age " . 

Martin stated that he would not retire from working . 

Doubts have been raised about all of Martin 's historical claims , including his age , which may have in truth been 97 at the time of his death .
