Doctors to Be is a biographical documentary series that was first broadcast on BBC Two by BBC Television and is also the name of a book , published by BBC Books , that accompanies the series . 

The television series follows 10 medical students who enrolled at St Mary 's Hospital Medical School ( now a part of Imperial College School of Medicine ) in the 1985 intake of students . 

It starts in 1984 with their admission interviews , then follows them through five or six years as medical students , and ends with their first experiences of working as busy junior hospital doctors in the National Health Service . 

The BBC decided to make the series in 1983 and the BBC contacted several medical schools . 

The BBC selected St Mary 's Hospital Medical School , London , England , partly because the dean , Prof Peter Richards , was enthusiastic about filming and thought that medical education was of public interest . 

Filming began in November 1984 when applicants were applying for university and going to interviews for the 1985 intake at St Mary 's Hospital Medical School . 

St Mary 's Medical School interviewed 419 applicants and 100 of these interviews were filmed . 

In the autumn of 1985 , when studies had started , every student in the year was asked if they wanted to take part in the television series , and 10 students , who were thought to be outgoing and resilient to the pressures of filming , were chosen by the BBC . 

Each of the 10 medical students was filmed regularly and about 300 hours of film accumulated in total . 

The series was one of the nominations for the best factual series at the 1992 British Academy Television Awards , although it did not win an award . 

An update , , was first broadcast on BBC Four in 2007 .
