Cabinet of Radoman Božović was sworn in on December 23 , 1991 , after the previous cabinet under Dragutin Zelenović resigned due to economic failure . 

As a Prime Minister of Serbia he was a hardcore bureaucrat , under whom more than half of Serbian economy was under state ownership . 

After only 100 days in office , the inflation reached a shocking 10,000 % . 

His term was marked by a scandal in which two ministers from his cabinet were arrested , as well as his frequent arguments with opposition leader Vojislav Šešelj . 

On February 10 , 1993 , the new minority cabinet of Socialist Party of Serbia , supported by Serbian Radical Party , was formed as a result of the December 20 , 1992 parliamentary elections . 

Božović , himself a Socialist , opposed the support from the Radicals , so he refused another term . 

This new cabinet was formed by Nikola Šainović .
