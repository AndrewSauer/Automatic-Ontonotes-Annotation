In the context of the recent African origin of modern humans , the Southern Dispersal scenario ( also the coastal migration hypothesis ) refers to the early migration along the southern coast of Asia , from the Arabian peninsula via Persia and India to Southeast Asia and Oceania . 

Alternative names include the " southern coastal route " or " rapid coastal settlement " . 

The coastal route theory is primarily used to describe the initial peopling of the Arabian peninsula , India , Southeast Asia , New Guinea , Australia , Near Oceania , coastal China , and Japan between roughly 70,000 to 60,000 years ago . 

It is linked with the presence and dispersal of mtDNA haplogroup M and haplogroup N , as well as the specific distribution patterns of Y - DNA haplogroup C and haplogroup D , in these regions . 

The theory proposes that early Homo sapiens , some of the bearers of mitochondrial haplogroup L3 arrived in the Arabian peninsula about 70,000 years ago , crossing from East Africa via the Bab - el - Mandeb straits . 

It has been estimated that from a population of 2,000 to 5,000 individuals in Africa , only a small group , possibly as few as 150 to 1,000 people , crossed the Red Sea . 

The group would have travelled along the coastal route around Arabia and Persia to India relatively rapidly , within a few thousand years . 

From India , they would have spread to Southeast Asia ( " Sundaland " ) and Oceania ( " Sahul " ) .
