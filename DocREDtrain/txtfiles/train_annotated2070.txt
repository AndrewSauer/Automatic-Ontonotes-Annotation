In his autobiography , , Lydon stated that the song was written for his mother , who had died of cancer not long before . 

" I watched her die , " he told Select in 1990 . 

" She was tough , my mum . 

She asked me to write a disco song for her funeral . 

This was hardly happy stuff . " 

According to AllMusic , " the song is built on a dense groove informed equally by dub and disco " and features both " Lydon at his most desperate and stark " and Keith Levene " dishing out shards of guitar that complement the rhythm one moment and then shift into horrific riffing the next . " 

" Death Disco " was also included on the 1983 album Live in Tokyo . 

The song was ranked at No . 

11 among the top " Tracks of the Year " of 1979 by NME . 

Paul Lester of The Guardian wrote that " Death Disco " was " the biggest hit with a load of rhythmical dissonance [ ... ] until the dosser disco of Happy Mondays ' 

" Hallelujah " ten years later . "
