The Kaldanes are a fictitious sapient species existing in the region of Bantoom on the planet Barsoom in the John Carter series of books by Edgar Rice Burroughs . 

Introduced in the book Chessmen of Mars , the Kaldanes are almost all head , but for six arachnoid legs and a pair of chelae . 

Their racial goal is to achieve pure intellect against bodily existence : 

In order to function in the physical realm , the Kaldanes have bred the Rykors : a nonsentient complementary species composed of a body similar to that of a Red Martian but lacking a head ; when the Kaldane places itself upon the shoulders of the Rykor , a bundle of tentacles connects with the Rykor 's spinal cord , allowing the brain of the Kaldane to control its motor nerves and sensory nerves . 

Should the Rykor become damaged or die , the Kaldane climbs upon another . 

Although the Rykors breed like other animals , the Kaldanes do not breed except for their " king " : 

The Kaldanes are also imbued with conscious race memory , obtained through selective breeding . 

They are carnivorous , and sometimes feed upon the Rykors . 

In the Wold Newton Universe , the kaldanes are mentioned as mutated Sarmaks and possibly descended from Cthulhuoids . 

In Larry Niven 's Rainbow Mars , Kaldanes also appear , although they are called the Tunnel Crabs .
