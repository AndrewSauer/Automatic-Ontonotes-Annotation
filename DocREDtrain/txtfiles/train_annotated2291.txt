South is Heather Nova 's sixth album . 

It spawned the U.S. single " Virus of the Mind " . 

There were two versions of this album ; the original release on December 11 , 2001 , and an American release on May 21 , 2002 . 

The U.S. release contained one extra track , " Welcome " , which also appeared on the 2005 album Redbird . 

For this album , Nova also recorded a contemporary - styled cover of the standard " Gloomy Sunday " , a song originally made popular by Billie Holiday . 

In retrospect , Nova found the album to be far too polished and not entirely to her liking . 

She declared that her next album , Storm , would be bare and would be the album she 's always wanted to make .
