Rudolf Hieronymus Eusebius von Colloredo - Waldsee , born 2 November 1585 in České Budějovice , Kingdom of Bohemia ( now in the Czech Republic ) , was a Bohemian nobleman and the brother of Hieronymus von Colloredo - Waldsee . 

A member of the Colloredo family , he distinguished himself in the Thirty Years ' War , especially at the Battles of Mantua and Lützen . 

Emperor Ferdinand III appointed him to the Imperial Privy Council and named him a Field Marshal . 

Although unable to prevent Prague Castle from falling to Sweden 's Hans Christoff von Königsmarck , Colloredo - Waldsee 's bold defense of Prague 's old town halted the Swedish invasion of Bohemia on 26 July 1648 and saved the Habsburg 's ancestral lands in Austria . 

After the war , he built the Schönborn Palace in Prague home to the United States Embassy to the Czech Republic . 

He died in Prague on 24 February 1657 .
