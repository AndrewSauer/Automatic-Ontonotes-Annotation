The Negri River is a river in Australia . 

It flows from the Northern Territory into Western Australia , where it merges with the Ord River to become part of the Ord River catchment . 

It is roughly 100 kilometres long . 

It was named by Alexander Forrest on 2 August 1879 , the same day he named the Ord River . 

The following is from his journal . 

We started on again today , and steering N. E. and E.N.E. 

for about six miles , we came to a large river , very similar in character to the one we have been following down during the last week . 

I have named this river the Negri , after Commander Christopher Negri of Turin . 

In all probability it joins the one we have just left ; so , after crossing it , we turned Northwards , hoping again to come upon the larger stream .
