Roberto Lardera ( December , 1911 – 1989 ) , was a notable Italian sculptor of the 20th Century . 

He was informally known as Berto Lardera . 

He was born in La Spezia , Italy , the son of a shipyard worker . 

He was self - taught and his leanings towards monumental , metallic sculptures may have been influenced by the sights he grew up with in the naval dockyards . 

In 1947 Lardera moved to Paris , where he remained until his death in 1989 . 

He exhibited at the Galerie Denise René and then at the Salon de Mai and the Salon des Réalités Nouvelles . 

Lardera 's sculpture began with abstract metal structures based on two dimensions , or a flat geometrical plane , which challenged the conventional form of sculpture based around volume and enclosed spaces . 

Later his work became more diverse , with his geometrical constructions branching out into the horizontal as well as the vertical plane and often resulting in series based on a single theme , such as his Miracles , Aubes and Archanges series . 

His sculptures are to be found the world over , in Europe , America and Japan . 

They show the use of a wide range of different metals , as well as different dimensions . 

Lardera did not produce very many prints , but his interest in using different planes and dimensions led to him making markedly " sculptural " prints . 

He used a unique technique , cutting forms and designs with his sculpting tools in thick iron plates from which the prints were pulled . 

He used no acid or chemical processes .
