" Eve of Destruction " is a protest song written by P. F. Sloan in mid-1964 . 

Several artists have recorded it , but the best - known recording was by Barry McGuire . 

This recording was made between July 12 and July 15 , 1965 , and released by Dunhill Records . 

The accompanying musicians were top - tier Los Angeles session players : P. F. Sloan on guitar , Hal Blaine ( of Phil Spector 's Wrecking Crew ) on drums , and Larry Knechtel on bass guitar . 

The vocal track was thrown on as a rough mix and was not intended to be the final version , but a copy of the recording " leaked " out to a disc jockey , who began playing it . 

The song was an instant hit and as a result the more polished vocal track that was at first envisioned was never recorded . 

McGuire 's single hit # 1 on the US Billboard Hot 100 and # 3 on the UK Singles Chart in September 1965 .
