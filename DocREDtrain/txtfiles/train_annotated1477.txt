The Warmiak are a Polish ethnic group from Warmia who are mostly Roman Catholics and who speak their own dialect of Polish , called gwara warmińska ( see : Dialects of the Polish language ) . 

Between the 14th and 17th centuries , settlers from northern Mazovia moved to former territories of Old Prussians , following conquests by the Teutonic Order , and the erection of the Monastic state of the Teutonic Knights . 

The bishopric of Warmia became in 1466 an autonomous part of Royal Prussia , and remained part of Polish – Lithuanian Commonwealth until 1772 ( see : Partitions of Poland ) . 

While Mazurs in the neighboring Ducal Prussia became Protestants when that Duchy adopted Lutheranism in the 16th century , most Warmiaks , populating the areas around Olsztyn , remained Catholics . 

During World War II , the Warmiaks were persecuted by the Nazi Germany government , which wanted to erase all aspects of Polish culture and Polish language in Warmia . 

After the war , due to their Polish roots , they were not victims of Expulsion of Germans after World War II , but in the course of the time , large numbers of Warmiaks decided to leave their native land and settle in more prosperous West Germany .
