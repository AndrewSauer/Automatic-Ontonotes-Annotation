The Missouri Photo Workshop is an annual week - long photojournalism school based in Lee Hills Hall at the Missouri School of Journalism in Columbia , Missouri . 

Founded in 1949 by the " Father of Photojournalism " Cliff Edom along with American economist , federal government official , and photographer Roy Stryker and photographer Russell Lee , the workshop originally sought to instruct others in photojournalism based on the " gritty , content - rich photographs " produced by the pre - World War II ( pre-1939 ) Farm Security Administration , a United States government effort during the Great Depression to combat American rural poverty . 

Following Edom 's credo - " Show truth with a camera . 

Ideally truth is a matter of personal integrity . 

In no circumstances will a posed or faked photograph be tolerated . " 

- each workshop originates in a different small town in Missouri , which is used as a backdrop for attendees from the United States and other countries to work on photograph storytelling methods such as research , observation , and timing . 

Missouri Photo Workshop faculty members have included the White House 's first photo editor and NPPA Picture Editor of the Year Sandra Eisert and other prominent photojournalists .
