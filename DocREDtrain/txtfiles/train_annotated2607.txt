Le Pays Réel ( French ; literally " The Real Country " ) was a Catholic - Fascist newspaper published by the Rexist Party in Belgium . 

Its first issue appeared on 3 May 1936 and it continued to be published during the Second World War . 

It was briefly edited by Victor Matthys . 

While the Pays Réel remained the main paper of Rex , it remained just one of several published by the group , or subsumed under Rexist control , during the war . 

The newspaper 's title derives from the writings of Charles Maurras , a French nationalist , who distinguished between a pays réel , rooted in the realities of life such as locality , work , trades , the parish and the family , and a pays légal ( " legal country " ) of law , constitutionalism , and liberal political ideals which he cast as artificially imposed on the " real " .
