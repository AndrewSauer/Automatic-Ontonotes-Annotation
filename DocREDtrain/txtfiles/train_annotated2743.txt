Sheng Long is a character hoax related to the Street Fighter series , created by Electronic Gaming Monthly ( EGM ) as an April Fools ' prank in 1992 ( in an issue published mid - February ) . 

The joke , based upon a mistranslation that suggested the existence of a character named Sheng Long in the Capcom fighting game Street Fighter II , described a method to fight the character in the game . 

After other publications reprinted the details as fact without verifying the authenticity , the Sheng Long hoax spread worldwide . 

As a result of discussion revolving around the possibility of the character 's appearance in Street Fighter III during the game 's development , EGM revisited the joke in 1997 , printing an updated version of the hoax for the title while establishing a backstory and appearance for the character in the process . 

As a character and a hoax , Sheng Long has been described as one of the most famous and well - known legends related to video gaming by publications such as GameDaily and GameSpot . 

The hoax influenced the creation of both Akuma and Gouken as characters in the Street Fighter series , with the former appearing in Super Street Fighter II Turbo as a secret boss . 

Fan appeal for the character affected later Capcom titles , with public requests for the inclusion of Sheng Long in an actual video game leading to the consideration of his inclusion in the video game and years later resulting in the appearance of Gouken as both a secret boss and playable character in Street Fighter IV .
