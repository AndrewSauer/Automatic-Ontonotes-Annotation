The Skirmish of the Berlin Schloss ( German : Weihnachtskämpfe or Weihnachtsaufstand i.e. 

Christmas eve struggle or rebellion ) was a small skirmish between the socialist revolutionary Volksmarinedivision and regular German army units on 24 December 1918 during the German Revolution of 1918 – 19 . 

It took place around the Berlin Schloss also known as " Stadtschloss " in the centre of Berlin , Germany . 

Around 70 people were killed and the event marked the point at which the hitherto largely bloodless revolution turned more violent . 

The fighting was the immediate cause for the more radical members to leave the revolutionary government and caused resentment among the workers against the Social Democratic government of Friedrich Ebert . 

This set the scene for the much larger - scale violence of January 1919 , known as the Spartacist Uprising . 

Since the revolutionary sailors defeated the regular army force sent against them , the engagement was also an important episode in the rise of the right - wing Freikorps on which the government increasingly relied .
