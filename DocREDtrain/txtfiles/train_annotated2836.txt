The Young Muslims UK ( YMUK ) was established in 1984 and celebrated its 25th Anniversary in 2009 . 

It became the youth wing of the Islamic Society of Britain ( ISB ) in 1990 with an aim to " provide a vehicle for committed young British Muslims to combine their knowledge , skills and efforts for the benefit of one another and British society as a whole . " 

The Young Muslims UK is an affiliate body of the Muslim Council of Britain . 

In 1995 , the organisation participated in the Euro - Islam conference in Stockholm , Sweden , organised on a directive from the Swedish Ministry for Foreign Affairs . 

The youth section of this conference was dominated by participants with connections to the Muslim Brotherhood and similar forms of ideology , for instance the Jamat - i Islami , according to French islamologist Gilles Kepel . 

This conference resulted in the founding of the Forum of European Youth and Student Organisations ( FEMYSO ) .
