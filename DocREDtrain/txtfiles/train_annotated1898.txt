Gardianul ( " The Guardian " ) was a Romanian daily newspaper published in Bucharest . 

It claimed to have had an anti - corruption stance , investigating organized crime and high - level corruption . 

The newspaper was founded in 2002 by Şerban Roibu , the son of a Social Democratic Party senator and therefore is accused of bias in favour of the Social Democratic Party , although it did publish articles which are critical of Social Democrat members being investigated for corruption . 

It eventually was sold to " Petrom Service " a company owned by the labour union of Petrom , but it kept its editorial stance . 

It was one of the newspapers involved in the ' governmental advertising funds for political subversion ' scandal of 2004 ( see Adrian Năstase ) . 

Overall the newspaper had a low readership and circulation for a national newspaper - at its peak distributing no more than 10.000 copies daily , out of which less than 6.000 paid for . 

Publishing of the newspaper ceased on 1 January 2010 , the editorial board claiming that Gardianul would switch to a web - only new - media format . 

However , by the end of January 2010 , Gardianuls website was also shut down .
