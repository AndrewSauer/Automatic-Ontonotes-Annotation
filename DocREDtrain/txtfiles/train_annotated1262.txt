The Battle of Talas , Battle of Talas River , or Battle of Artlakh (; ) was a military engagement between the Arab Abbasid Caliphate along with their ally the Tibetan Empire against the Chinese Tang dynasty , governed at the time by Emperor Xuanzong . 

In July 751 CE , Tang and Abbasid forces met in the valley of the Talas River to vie for control over the Syr Darya region of central Asia . 

After several days of stalemate , the Karluks originally allied to the Tang defected to the Abbasids and tipped over the balance of power , resulting in a Tang rout . 

The defeat marked the end of Tang westward expansion and resulted in Muslim control of Transoxiana for the next 400 years . 

Control of this region was economically beneficial for the Abbasids because it was on the Silk Road . 

Historians debate whether or not Chinese prisoners captured in the aftermath of the battle brought paper - making technology to the Middle East , where it eventually spread to Europe .
