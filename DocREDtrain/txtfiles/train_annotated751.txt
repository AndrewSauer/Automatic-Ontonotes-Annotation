Melanesia ( , ) is a subregion of Oceania extending from New Guinea island in the southwestern Pacific Ocean to the Arafura Sea , and eastward to Fiji . 

The region includes the four independent countries of Vanuatu , Solomon Islands , Fiji , and Papua New Guinea , as well as the French special collectivity of New Caledonia , and the Indonesian region of Western New Guinea . 

Most of the region is in the Southern Hemisphere , with a few small northwestern islands of Western New Guinea in the Northern Hemisphere . 

The name Melanesia ( in French Mélanésie ) was first used by Jules Dumont d'Urville in 1832 to denote an ethnic and geographical grouping of islands whose inhabitants he thought were distinct from those of Micronesia and Polynesia .
