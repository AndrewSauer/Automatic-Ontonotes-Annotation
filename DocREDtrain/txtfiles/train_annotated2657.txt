The Shoemaker 's Holiday or the Gentle Craft is an Elizabethan play written by Thomas Dekker . 

The play was first performed in 1599 by the Admiral 's Men , and it falls into the subgenre of city comedy . 

The story features three subplots : an inter - class romance between a citizen of London and an aristocrat , the ascension of shoemaker Simon Eyre to Lord Mayor of London , and a romance between a gentleman and a shoemaker 's wife , whose husband appears to have died in the wars with France . 

The play is a " citizen " drama , or a depiction of the life of members of London 's livery companies , and it follows in Dekker 's style of depicting everyday life in London . 

The events of the play occur during the reign of King Henry VI , though also hinting at the reign of Henry V. Henry V succeeded his father , Henry IV , as leader of England following Henry IV 's death in 1413 at the age of 26 . 

He is best known for securing the French crown and for his depiction in Shakespeare 's plays Henry IV , Part 1 , Henry IV , Part 2 , and Henry V. Dekker uses this correlation in The Shoemaker 's Holiday , as an English king appears in scenes 19 and 21 ; however , he is only identified as " The King " in the speech prefix in the first printed edition of the play .
