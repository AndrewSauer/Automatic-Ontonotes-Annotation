El Gran Combo de Puerto Rico , commonly known as El Gran Combo , is a Puerto Rican salsa orchestra based in San Juan , Puerto Rico . 

Celebrating its 50th anniversary in 2012 , it is Puerto Rico 's most successful musical group , and is considered " the most popular Salsa group that has ever existed " . 

The group received the moniker La Universidad de la Salsa ( The University of Salsa ) in Colombia , due to the sheer number of famous salsa musicians and singers who developed their careers with it , who started with the group ( particularly Andy Montañez ) , or who were occasionally backed up by the band ( including Celia Cruz , Héctor Lavoe and La India ) . 

The salsa orchestra was founded in May 1962 , by Rafael Ithier . 

Ithier is still nominally its musical director , and is the only remaining members from the band 's original lineup . 

As of 2010 , Willie Sotelo , who joined the group in 2006 as pianist , has become the band 's de facto musical director on tours , with Ithier conducting the group and playing occasionally in select live performances . 

They are still actively performing after 50 years together . 

The group was scheduled to celebrate its 50th anniversary on 11 November 2012 at the Coliseo de Puerto Rico . 

The group started its celebration with a grand world tour that took them to five continents .
