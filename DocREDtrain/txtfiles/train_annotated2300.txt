For over a thousand years before the arrival of European explorers , Sycamore Shoals and adjacent lands had been inhabited by Native Americans . 

The first permanent European settlers arrived in 1770 , and established the Watauga Association — one of the first written constitutional governments west of the Appalachian Mountains — in 1772 . 

Richard Henderson and Daniel Boone negotiated the Treaty of Sycamore Shoals in 1775 , which saw the sale of millions of acres of Cherokee lands in Kentucky and Tennessee and led to the building of the Wilderness Road . 

During the American Revolution , Sycamore Shoals was both the site of Fort Watauga , where part of a Cherokee invasion was thwarted in 1776 , and the mustering ground for the Overmountain Men in 1780 .
