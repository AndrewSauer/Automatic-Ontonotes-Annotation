Columbia Island is an island located in the Potomac River in Washington , D.C. , in the United States . 

It formed naturally as an extension of Analostan Island in the latter part of the 1800s , and over time erosion and flooding severed it from Analostan . 

The U.S. federal government deposited material dredged from the Potomac River on the island between 1911 and 1922 , and again from 1925 to 1927 . 

The island was also reshaped by the government at this time . 

It received the name " Columbia Island " about 1918 . 

In 1968 , the island was renamed Lady Bird Johnson Park . 

Located within the park are the Lyndon Baines Johnson Memorial Grove , Navy â€“ Merchant Marine Memorial , and the Columbia Island Marina . 

The island , park , memorials , and marina are part of the George Washington Memorial Parkway and administered by the National Park Service .
