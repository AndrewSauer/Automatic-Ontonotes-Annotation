Johnny Mathis Sings the Music of Bacharach & Kaempfert is an album by American pop singer Johnny Mathis that was released in the fall of 1970 by Columbia Records . 

While one half of the two - record set was a compilation of tracks from his previous albums that were composed by Burt Bacharach , the other consisted of new recordings of songs composed by Bert Kaempfert , including a new version of " Strangers in the Night " , which Mathis had already recorded in 1966 for his LP Johnny Mathis Sings . 

Although the Kaempfert tribute was similar to recent Mathis albums in that he was mainly covering songs made popular by other singers , it was absent of hits from the 12 months previous to its release that had become the pattern of his output at this point . 

The latest US chartings of any of the Kaempfert compositions as of this album 's debut came from 1967 recordings of " Lady " by Jack Jones and " The Lady Smiles " by Matt Monro . 

The album made its first appearance on Billboard magazine 's Top LP 's chart in the issue dated January 23 , 1971 , and reached number 169 during its seven weeks there . 

Sides one and two of Kaempfert songs had already been released in the UK as Johnny Mathis Sings the Music of Bert Kaempfert in November 1969 .
