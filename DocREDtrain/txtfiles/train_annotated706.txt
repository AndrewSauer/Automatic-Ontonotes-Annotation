Cleft of the Rock Light is a privately owned lighthouse located on the Pacific coast of the U.S. state of Oregon , south of Yachats on Cape Perpetua . 

It was built in 1976 by former Tillamook Rock Light attendant and lighthouse historian James A. Gibbs who was active in preserving the lantern room of Smith Island Light . 

Cleft of the Rock Light is designed after Fiddle Reef Light , which operated from 1898 to 1958 in Oak Bay , British Columbia , a suburb of Victoria , British Columbia , Canada . 

The Cleft 's tower contains a stair railing from the original keeper 's dwelling at Yaquina Head Light . 

Other historic items include a stopwatch from Desdemona Sands Light , two brass oil cans from Tillamook Rock Light and Heceta Head Light , and a crank handle which wound the weights at Point Sur Light . 

It also has two fourth order Fresnel lenses . 

The Coast Guard made it an official navigational marker in 1979 . 

The lighthouse is part of Gibbs ' home , which also houses a private museum . 

The grounds and tower are closed to the public , however they are visible from U.S. Route 101 near mile marker 166 . 

It is just outside the northwest corner of the Cape Perpetua National Scenic Area . 

Gibbs died at home on 30 April 2010 . 

His daughter and son - in - law — who lived at the property for 27 years with Gibbs — intended to maintain the lighthouse as an official aid to navigation . 

The facility is still closed to the public . 

Cleft of the Rock is named after Fanny Crosby 's hymn He Hideth My Soul in the Cleft of the Rock , which is based .
