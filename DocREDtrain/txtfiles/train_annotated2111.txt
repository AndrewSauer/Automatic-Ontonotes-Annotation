Patricia Stephens Due ( December 9 , 1939 â€“ February 7 , 2012 ) was one of the leading African - American civil rights activists in the United States , especially in her home state of Florida . 

Along with her sister Priscilla and others trained in nonviolent protest by CORE , Due spent 49 days in one of the nation 's first jail - ins , refusing to pay a fine for sitting in a Woolworth 's " White only " lunch counter in Tallahassee , Florida in 1960 . 

Her eyes were damaged by tear gas used by police on students marching to protest such arrests , and she wore dark glasses for the rest of her life . 

She served in many leadership roles in CORE and the NAACP , fighting against segregated stores , buses , theaters , schools , restaurants , and hotels , protesting unjust laws , and leading one of the most dangerous voter registration efforts in the country in northern Florida in the 1960s .
