Each country that is a signatory to the Antarctic Treaty establishes a National Antarctic Program , which has national responsibility for managing the support of scientific research ; contribute to the governance and protect the environment of the Antarctic Treaty Area on behalf of its government and in the spirit of the Antarctic Treaty . 

Forming National Antarctic Programs after signing the treaty is not mandatory but all those countries which have permanent research stations in Antarctica or carry out scientific research otherwise , generally do so . 

Till date 48 countries have signed the Antarctic Treaty which was drafted and negotiated back in 1959 . 

Out of these , only 28 countries have the Consultative status i.e. 

these Parties have the right to participate in Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meetings ( ATCM ) and are accordingly known as Consultative Parties and their presence in Antarctica is shown by carrying substantial research there . 

The National Antarctic Programs of these 28 countries are available in the following section all of whom have established either permanent or summer research stations in Antarctica . 

These countries are also members of COMNAP , the Council of Managers of National Antarctic Programs . 

The membership of COMNAP is open only to National Antarctic Programs from nations whose governments are signatories to the Antarctic Treaty and have ratified its Protocol on Environmental Protection .
