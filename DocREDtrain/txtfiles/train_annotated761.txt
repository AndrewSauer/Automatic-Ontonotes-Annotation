Pontiac Assembly was one of four General Motors assembly plants in Pontiac , Michigan located along Baldwin Avenue . 

It served as the main facility for Pontiac Motor Division since it was built in 1927 . 

It is across the street from the currently operational Pontiac Metal Center , which was the original location for the Oakland Motor Car Company , which Pontiac evolved into . 

The plant ceased production of full - size Pontiacs after the 1980 model year , and was idled on August 6 , 1982 . 

Another production line was opened in 1983 to build the Fiero . 

The old production line was reopened January 14 , 1985 to build the GM " G " body Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme and Buick Regal , as the Lansing and Flint plants which built them had been converted to new front - wheel - drive car lines . 

Chevrolet Monte Carlo production was added for 1987 , and Pontiac Grand Prix production returned in October 1987 . 

Production ended on December 11 , 1987 . 

Fiero production ended on August 16 , 1988 , and the plant was permanently closed . 

Manufacturing operations were transferred to Orion Assembly .
