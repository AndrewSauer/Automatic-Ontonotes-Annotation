Of True Religion , Heresy , Schism , Toleration ; and what best means may be used against the Growth of Popery is the title of a polemical tract against the popery of the Roman Catholic Church written by John Milton which was published in London in 1673 . 

The tract addresses Milton 's own problems with the doctrines , practices , and ceremonies associated with the pope or the papal system of the Roman Catholic Church and , with what Milton called , the implicit faith of its members . 

The anti - Catholic ideas in Milton 's writing are in direct response to the tolerant stance of King Charles II of England toward the Roman Catholic Church . 

Pro - Catholic sentiments had not been popular in England since the very bloody reign of the devout Roman Catholic queen Mary I of England . 

The obvious anti - Catholic ideas present in Milton 's writing , coupled with Milton 's own influence , may have inspired such social movements as the Glorious Revolution of 1688 and the eventual passing of the Popery Act of 1698 .
