Big Star 's Third refers to a series of tribute concerts built on Big Star 's 1975 album Third / Sister Lovers . 

Regarded as a " lost masterpiece , " and described as " the soundtrack to a nervous breakdown , " the material from Third / Sister Lovers was first played live and fully orchestrated in December 2010 , when two dozen musicians performed it at the Cat 's Cradle in Carrboro , North Carolina . 

Since then , Big Star 's Third concerts have taken place in the United States , the UK , and Australia . 

Although the performers rotate from show to show , a core group of musicians , including Jody Stephens , Big Star 's original drummer , Mike Mills of R.E.M. , Chris Stamey from The dB 's , and Mitch Easter of Let 's Active have been involved in the majority of the Big Star 's Third shows .
