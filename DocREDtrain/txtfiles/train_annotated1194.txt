During the heyday of rail transportation in the first half of the 20th century , Chicago , Illinois reigned as the undisputed railroad center of the United States and was served by six intercity train terminals . 

With the decline of rail passenger service many of these facilities disappeared ; today only Union Station remains in use in a substantially original form , and is the only one served by Amtrak trains . 

The Chicago and North Western Passenger Terminal has been replaced with a newer station and renamed Ogilvie Transportation Center , and LaSalle Street Station has also been replaced with a newer facility . 

Millennium Station is on the site of the pre-1893 Illinois Central Railroad Great Central Station , used since then only for commuter trains . 

All four stations are used by Metra commuter service . 

The table below shows all lines that have served downtown Chicago and what terminal they used . 

A red background indicates that the railroad owned a part or full share of the terminal . 

NOTE : The Chicago , Terre Haute and Southeastern Railway , later part of the Chicago , Milwaukee , St. Paul and Pacific Railroad , never had passenger service in the Chicago area .
