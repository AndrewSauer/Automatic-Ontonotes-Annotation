Egges Teater ( ' Egge 's Theatre ' ) was a historic theatre in Norrköping in Sweden , active between 1762 and 1798 . 

It was the first theatre in Sweden outside the capital of Stockholm . 

In the 18th - century , Norrköping was the third city in Sweden , and there was a need for more entertainment in the prosperous city . 

The theatre was founded by the merchant Johan Ulric Egge ( 1730 – 1795 ) , who owned a popular restaurant , and named Egge 's after him . 

The theatre was situated in the centre of the city , between the Hedvig Church and the bridge across the Motala ström , and near the restaurant , the pleasure gardens and reading parlour own by Egge . 

The theatre house was relatively simple , a rectangle of wood , 18 metres long . 

As all theatres in Sweden at the time , with the exception of Stockholm and Gothenburg , it was used by travelling theater companies . 

Other entertainments where also offered , such as public concerts , vax cabinets , acrobatics , circus performances and bear beating ; liquor was also served . 

The theater was inaugurated in 1762 by the theater company of Carl Seuerling , who regularly visited the city for thirty years . 

On 5 August 1776 , Romeo and Juliet by Shakespeare was performed on a Swedish stage for the first time by the Seuerling Company , with Margareta Seuerling as Juliet . 

In 1795 , during a performance by the theater company of Johan Peter Lewenhagen , La Marseillaise was performed onstage , which lead to a scandal , actions for the de facto regent Gustaf Adolf Reuterholm and for the theatre to be closed . 

It was replaced by the Saltängsteatern ( ' Salt Medow Theatre ' ) , which became the new stage for visiting theater companies in Norrköping ( 1798 - 1850 ) .
