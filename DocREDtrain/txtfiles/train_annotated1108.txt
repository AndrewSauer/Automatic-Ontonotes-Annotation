Mabel Gardiner Hubbard ( November 25 , 1857 â€“ January 3 , 1923 ) , was the daughter of Boston lawyer Gardiner Greene Hubbard , who was the first president of the Bell Telephone Company . 

As the wife of Alexander Graham Bell , an eminent scientist and the inventor of the first practical telephone , she took the married name Mabel Bell . 

From the time of Mabel 's courtship with Graham Bell in 1873 , until his death in 1922 , Mabel became and remained the most significant influence in his life . 

Folklore held that Bell undertook telecommunication experiments in an attempt to restore her hearing which had been destroyed by disease close to her fifth birthday , leaving her completely deaf for the remainder of her life .
