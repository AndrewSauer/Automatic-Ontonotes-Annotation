Beta cloth is a type of fireproof silica fiber cloth used in the manufacture of Apollo / Skylab A7L space suits , the Apollo Thermal Micrometeoroid Garment , the McDivitt Purse , and in other specialized applications . 

Beta cloth consists of fine woven silica fiber , similar to fiberglass . 

The resulting fabric will not burn , and will melt only at temperatures exceeding . 

To reduce its tendency to crease or tear when manipulated , and to increase durability , the fibers are coated with Teflon . 

A tight weave of Beta cloth makes it more durable against atomic oxygen exposure . 

Its ability to resist atomic oxygen exposure makes it commonly used as the outer - most layer in multi - layer insulation for space , and it was used significantly on the Space Shuttle and the International Space Station . 

It was implemented in NASA space suits after the deadly 1967 Apollo 1 launch pad fire , in which the astronauts ' nylon suits burned through . 

After the fire , NASA demanded any potentially flammable materials were to be removed from both the spacecraft and space suits . 

Beta cloth was developed by a Manned Spacecraft Center team led by Frederick S. Dawn and including Matthew I. Radnofsky working with the Owens - Corning and DuPont companies . 

Where additional wear resistance was needed , external patches of Chromel - R metallic cloth were used . 

Beta cloth was used as the material for the Skylab shower enclosure . 

The interior of the Space Shuttle payload bay was almost completely covered with Beta cloth . 

This helps protect while staying open for weeks at a time in space . 

Some Beta cloth is used on MSL 's rover Curiosity .
