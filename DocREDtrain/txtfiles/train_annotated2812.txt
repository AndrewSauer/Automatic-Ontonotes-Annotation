KBOI is a commercial AM radio station in the western United States , located in Boise , Idaho , broadcasting on 670 kHz under ownership of Cumulus Media . 

KBOI airs news / talk programming . 

Studios are located on Bannock Street in downtown Boise , while it transmits from a six - tower facility southeast of Nampa . 

KBOI is Idaho 's most powerful AM station , broadcasting at 50,000 watts around the clock . 

During the day , a single tower beams the station 's full power to southwestern Idaho and eastern Oregon by day . 

At night , power is fed to all six towers in a directional pattern to avoid interfering with WSCR in Chicago , the Clear - channel station on 670 Â  kHz . 

Even though it must direct its signal north - south as a result , KBOI can still be heard across most of western North America at night . 

KBOI is licensed by the FCC to broadcast in the HD ( hybrid digital ) format , although it currently does not have HD turned on as of 7 March 2018 .
