Tin Machine is the debut album by Anglo - American hard rock band Tin Machine . 

It was originally released in May 1989 , on the label EMI . 

The band was the latest venture of David Bowie , inspired by sessions with guitarist Reeves Gabrels . 

Drummer Hunt Sales and bassist Tony Fox Sales formed the rest of the band , with " fifth member " Kevin Armstrong providing rhythm guitar and Hammond organ . 

The project was intended as a back - to - basics album by Bowie , with a hard rock sound and simple production , as opposed to his past two solo albums . 

Unlike previous Bowie bands ( such as the Spiders from Mars ) , Tin Machine acted as a democratic unit .
