The Battle of Mansfield on 8 April 1864 in Louisiana formed part of the Red River Campaign during the American Civil War , when Union forces were attempting to occupy the Louisiana state capital , Shreveport . 

The Confederate commander , Major General Richard Taylor , chose Mansfield as the place where he would make his stand against the advancing Union army under General Nathaniel Banks . 

Taylor concentrated his forces at Sabine Crossroads , knowing that reinforcements were nearby . 

Banks prepared for a fight , though his own army was not fully assembled either . 

Both sides were reinforced by stages throughout the day . 

After a brief resistance , the Union army was routed by the Confederates , consisting mainly of units from Louisiana and Texas , reportedly strengthened by hundreds of men breaking parole . 

The engagement is also known as the Battle of Sabine Crossroads .
