The following is an incomplete list of people who have either declined or renounced an Indian honour or decoration . 

These include recipients of the Bharat Ratna and the Padma awards ( Padma Vibhushan , Padma Bhushan , Padma Shri ) , along with other Indian governmental awards . 

In some instances , the families of an intended posthumous recipient of a national honour have declined the award for various reasons . 

The President of India may cancel and annul any honour if the recipient commits any acts of criminal misconduct or otherwise abuses the award . 

As there are no specific guidelines for otherwise withdrawing a national honour from a recipient , the acts of returning / renouncing an award to register a protest , or refusing an award after an official awards list has been published , are only symbolic actions . 

For instance , while independence activist and educationist Asha Devi Aryanayakam refused the Padma Shri after it was conferred upon her in 1954 , she remains on the official register of Padma awardees . 

In 1984 , poet and novelist Khushwant Singh , a 1974 Padma Bhushan honoree , returned the honour to protest the Indian army 's Operation Blue Star ; in spite of this , he remains listed as a Padma Bhushan recipient .
