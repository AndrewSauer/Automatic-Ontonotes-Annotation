The Skin Mechanic is a live album released by British musician Gary Numan during his stint with IRS Records . 

The album was recorded in 1988 and released in 1989 . 

Throughout September and October 1988 , Numan embarked on an 18-date UK live tour to support his latest studio album , Metal Rhythm . 

The Skin Mechanic ( which took its name from a lyric in the Metal Rhythm song " Hunger " ) was recorded at the Dominion Theatre , London on 28 September 1988 . 

The album was released over a year later , in October 1989 . 

It charted at UK#55 , and was followed by a 1990 video release of the 1989 tour , also confusingly called The Skin Mechanic . 

A remastered CD reissue appeared in 1999 with a shuffled track order ( but no additional tracks ) and a much expanded booklet that contained the lyrics and an essay by Steve Malins .
