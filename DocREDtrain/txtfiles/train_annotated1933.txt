Carry on at Your Convenience , released in 1971 , is the 22nd in the series of Carry On films to be made , and was the first box office failure of the series . 

This failure has been attributed to the film 's attempt at exploring the political themes of the trade union movement , crucially portraying the union activists as idle , pedantic buffoons which , apparently , alienated the traditional working - class audience of the series . 

The film , known as Carry On Round the Bend outside the United Kingdom , did not return full production costs until 1976 after several international and television sales . 

The film features regulars Sid James , Kenneth Williams , Charles Hawtrey , Joan Sims , Hattie Jacques and Bernard Bresslaw . 

It features Kenneth Cope in the first of his two Carry on appearances .
