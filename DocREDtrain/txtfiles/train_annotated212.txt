Awareness ribbons are symbols meant to show support or raise consciousness for a cause . 

Different colours and patterns are associated with different issues . 

Yellow ribbons , in the United States , are used to show that a close family member is abroad in military service . 

In Russia , Belarus and other countries of the former Soviet Union , gold and black striped ribbons are used to celebrate the Allies ' victory in World War II ( 9 May ) . 

Of the uses of ribbons to draw awareness to health issues , perhaps the best - known is the pink ribbon for support of those with breast cancer . 

Other health and social concerns which have adopted coloured ribbons include Alzheimer 's disease , pancreatic cancer ( purple ) , HIV / AIDS ( red ) , bipolar disorder ( green ) , and brain disorder or disability ( silver ) . 

Political use of ribbons include red ribbons worn to commemorate the October Revolution ( 7 November ) in the former Soviet Union , and orange ribbons in the Orange Revolution in Ukraine . 

Other ornaments , including flowers ( of specific kinds ) , bracelets and badges may serve essentially the same purpose of drawing attention to a cause . 

These include poppies , rosettes and wristbands .
