According to Primary chronicle , Oleg killed Lyut , the son of Yaropolk 's chief adviser and military commander Sveneld , when he hunted in the Drevlyan lands which Oleg regarded as his own . 

In an act of revenge and at the insistence of Sveneld , Yaropolk went to war against his brother Oleg and killed him in Ovruch .
