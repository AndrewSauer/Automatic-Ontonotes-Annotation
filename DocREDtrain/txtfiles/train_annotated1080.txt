The Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity ( Libertad ) Act of 1996 ( Helms â€“ Burton Act , , , ) is a United States federal law which strengthens and continues the United States embargo against Cuba . 

The act extended the territorial application of the initial embargo to apply to foreign companies trading with Cuba , and penalized foreign companies allegedly " trafficking " in property formerly owned by U.S. citizens but confiscated by Cuba after the Cuban revolution . 

The act also covers property formerly owned by Cubans who have since become U.S. citizens . 

The Act is named for its original sponsors , Senator Jesse Helms , Republican of North Carolina , and Representative Dan Burton , Republican of Indiana . 

The law was passed by the 104th United States Congress on March 6 , 1996 and enacted into law by the 42nd President of the United States Bill Clinton on March 12 , 1996 . 

The bill , which had been tabled in late 1995 after Senator Helms was unable to overcome several Democratic filibusters , was reintroduced prompted by an episode that happened a month earlier . 

On February 24 , 1996 , Cuban fighter jets shot down two private planes operated by a Miami - based humanitarian international Search and Rescue support group called Brothers to the Rescue ( ) , which had been on a search and locate mission over international waters . 

Whether they were shot down over Cuban territory or international airspace is a matter of debate .
