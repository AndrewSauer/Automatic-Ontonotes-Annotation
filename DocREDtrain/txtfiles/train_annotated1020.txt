Live & Inspired is the first live album to be released by the heavy metal band Godsmack . 

Released on May 15 , 2012 , the album includes a bonus disc of four cover version recordings . 

Live and Inspired features live renditions of songs from each of the Massachusetts band 's first four studio albums . 

Disc " 1 " of the album contains 13 tracks recorded during the band 's performance at the Detroit Fox Theatre in 2010 , with the band 's leader , Sully Erna , stating that the venue has a " special kind of fan base " . 

Although released two years after their then latest studio album , The Oracle , the tracks were performed prior to the release of that album , thus none of its tracks show up on the set list . 

Disc 2 contains various covers of other rock artists .
