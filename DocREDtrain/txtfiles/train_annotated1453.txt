The Ashcan School , also called the Ash Can School , was an artistic movement in the United States during the early 20th century that is best known for works portraying scenes of daily life in New York , often in the city 's poorer neighborhoods . 

The most famous artists working in this style included Robert Henri ( 1865 – 1929 ) , George Luks ( 1867 – 1933 ) , William Glackens ( 1870 – 1938 ) , John Sloan ( 1871 – 1951 ) , and Everett Shinn ( 1876 – 1953 ) , some of whom had met studying together under the renowned realist Thomas Anshutz at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts , and others of whom met in the newspaper offices of Philadelphia where they worked as illustrators . 

The movement has been seen as emblematic of the spirit of political rebellion of the period .
