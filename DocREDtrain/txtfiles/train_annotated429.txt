The Church of Sant'Orsola ( St Ursula ) in Mantua , Italy , was designed and built in 1608 by Antonio Maria Viani , the architect of the ducal court of the House of Gonzaga . 

The church was commissioned by Margherita Gonzaga d'Este , the widow of Alfonso II d'Este . 

Margherita , while not a nun herself , as a widow came to live in an apartment in the Clarissan monastery that was once adjacent ( destroyed in 1930 ) . 

The octagonal church was decorated by major regional artists including Domenico Fetti and his sister ( and nun at the convent ) Lucrina , Lodovico Carracci , Carlo Bonomi , and Antonio Maria Viani . 

After suppression of the convent in the 1780s , the convent had become a hospital .
