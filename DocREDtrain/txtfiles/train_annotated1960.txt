St. James ' Gate Brewery ( ) is a brewery founded in 1759 in Dublin , Ireland , by Arthur Guinness . 

The company is now a part of Diageo , a company formed from the merger of Guinness and Grand Metropolitan in 1997 . 

The main product of the brewery is Guinness Draught . 

Originally leased in 1759 to Arthur Guinness at IR£45 ( Irish pounds ) per year for 9,000 years , St. James ' Gate has been the home of Guinness ever since . 

It became the largest brewery in Ireland in 1838 , and the largest in the world by 1886 , with an annual output of 1.2   million barrels . 

Although no longer the largest brewery in the world , it is still the largest brewer of stout in the world . 

The company has since bought out the originally leased property , and during the 19th and early 20th centuries the brewery owned most of the buildings in the surrounding area , including many streets of housing for brewery employees , and offices associated with the brewery . 

The brewery also made all of its own power using its own power plant . 

There is an attached exhibition on the 250-year - old history of Guinness , called the Guinness Storehouse .
