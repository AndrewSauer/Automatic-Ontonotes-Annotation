The Battle of the Teutoburg Forest ( , Hermannsschlacht , or Varusschlacht , ) , described as the Varian Disaster ( Clades Variana ) by Roman historians , took place in the Teutoburg Forest in 9 CE , when an alliance of Germanic tribes ambushed and decisively destroyed three Roman legions and their auxiliaries , led by Publius Quinctilius Varus . 

The alliance was led by Arminius , a Germanic officer of Varus ' auxilia . 

Arminius had acquired Roman citizenship and had received a Roman military education , which enabled him to deceive the Roman commander methodically and anticipate the Roman army 's tactical responses . 

Despite several successful campaigns and raids by the Romans in the years after the battle , they never again attempted to conquer the Germanic territories east of the Rhine river . 

The victory of the Germanic tribes against Rome 's legions in the Teutoburg Forest would have far - reaching effects on the subsequent history of both the ancient Germanic peoples and the Roman Empire . 

Contemporary and modern historians have generally regarded Arminius ' victory over Varus as " Rome 's greatest defeat " , one of the most decisive battles recorded in military history , and as " a turning - point in world history " .
