Civil Revolution ( , RC ) was a left - wing coalition of political parties in Italy . 

The coalition was headed by Antonio Ingroia , a former anti - mafia prosecutor of Palermo from 1992 to 2012 and then director of a UN investigation into illegal drug trade in Guatemala in 2012 . 

The foundation of RC was preceded by the manifesto Io ci sto , presented by Ingroia on 21 December in Rome . 

Among the signatories of this appeal were Franco Battiato , Fiorella Mannoia , Luigi de Magistris , Leoluca Orlando , Milly Moratti , Massimiliano Bruno , Max Paiella , Sabina Guzzanti , Vauro and Enrico Fierro . 

The coalition had an anti - corruption platform . 

In the 2013 general election the party obtained 2.2 % of the vote , returning no seats in the Italian Parliament . 

Soon after RC was dissolved on 2 April 2013 , and Ingroia launched Civil Action , a non - party association .
