The Emergency ( ) was the state of emergency which existed in the state of Ireland during the Second World War . 

The state of Ireland remained neutral throughout the war . 

" The Emergency " has been used metonymically in historical and cultural commentary to refer to the state during the war . 

The state of emergency was proclaimed by Dáil Éireann on 2 September 1939 , allowing the passage of the Emergency Powers Act 1939 by the Oireachtas the following day . 

This gave sweeping new powers to the government for the duration of the Emergency , including internment , censorship of the press and correspondence , and government control of the economy . 

The Emergency Powers Act lapsed on 2 September 1946 . 

Although the state of emergency itself was not rescinded until 1 September 1976 , no emergency legislation was ever in force after 1946 to exploit this anomaly .
