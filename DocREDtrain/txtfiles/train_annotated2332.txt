The Celebrity Apprentice is an American television reality competition series . 

It is a variation of The Apprentice series , and was hosted by real estate developer ( and now U.S. President ) Donald Trump from 2008 to 2015 , and actor and former California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger from January 2017 . 

On August 3 , 2017 , NBC Entertainment Chairman Bob Greenblatt said that the show has effectively been canceled . 

Like its precursor , the show 's opening theme song is " For the Love of Money " by The O'Jays . 

Unlike its precursor , however , Celebrity Apprentice consists of celebrities as competing apprentices rather than unknowns . 

Some of the celebrities are relatively current while others tend to be those who have been out of the public eye for some time . 

All of them are competing to win money for a charitable organization of their choice . 

The celebrities come from a wide variety of different fields in the media : sitcoms , professional sports , music industry , reality television , radio , and other backgrounds . 

The Celebrity Apprentice is linked in seasons to its precursor TV show , The Apprentice , which consists of seasons one to six and season ten . 

The Celebrity Apprentice consists of seasons seven to nine and eleven to fifteen .
