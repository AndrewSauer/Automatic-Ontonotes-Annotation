The Peace Arch Border Crossing connects the towns of Blaine , Washington and Surrey , British Columbia on the Canada â€“ United States border . 

The crossing is reached by Interstate 5 on the American side and by British Columbia Highway 99 on the Canadian side . 

It serves the most direct route between the major cities of Seattle , Washington and Vancouver , British Columbia , and the crossing is the third - busiest on the border with up to 4,800 cars a day . 

Wait times can be up to four hours ; traffic lights exist on the southbound lane , with timers showing when the light will turn green so drivers can turn off engines , visit the park , and use public restrooms . 

Between the two border stations sits the Peace Arch Park , where visitors are free to cross the border within the confines of the park . 

Border inspection services at this crossing long predated the 1921 construction of the Peace Arch . 

The Canada border station is known as " Douglas " , although it has been known over the years as " White Rock " and " Surrey " . 

The US border station is known as " Blaine - Peace Arch " . 

The crossing is less than a mile west of the Pacific Highway Border Crossing ; trucks and other commercial vehicles have been prohibited from using the Peace Arch crossing since the 1970s , in an effort to improve the visitation experience of the park .
