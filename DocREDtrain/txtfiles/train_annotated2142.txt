The Stuttgart Congress of the Social Democratic Party of Germany ( SPD ) was held between October 3–October 8 , 1898 , in Stuttgart , Kingdom of Württemberg ( now Germany ) . 

The Stuttgart Congress was the first congress to discuss the question of revisionism in the SPD . 

A statement sent by Eduard Bernstein , who was exiled , was read to the Congress . 

In it he exposed and defended his revisionist views , previously exhibited in the series of articles Problems of Socialism published in the magazine Die Neue Zeit ( " The New Times " ) . 

In the Congress , Karl Kautsky and August Bebel made an initial critique of Bernsteinism . 

Rosa Luxemburg maintained a more intransigent position against Bernstein 's revisionism . 

The Congress did not adopt a resolution on this matter , but , despite the division in how to treat the question of Bernsteinism , the majority of the party showed its opposition to it . 

In the Hanover Congress of 1899 , the party approved a resolution that formally condemned Bernsteinist attacks on the party 's policy and tactics .
