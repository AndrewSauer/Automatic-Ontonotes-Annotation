The lake chubsucker ( Erimyzon sucetta ) is a freshwater fish endemic to North America , being found in the Great Lakes and the Mississippi River basin , as far north as Ontario , Canada , extending south to the Gulf of Mexico . 

It is mostly found in lakes , ponds , and swamps , rarely in streams . 

It is a freshwater fish , and intermediate level consumer as it feeds on benthic detritus . 

More specifically it eats microcrustacea and midge larvae . 

Its average length is 25.8 Â  cm . 

E. sucetta reportedly scatters its eggs randomly over aquatic vegetation and submerged grass in ponds or over gravelly areas cleared by males . 

While the chubsucker is not in acute danger , 50 % of its current range is secure , it is facing some difficulties because of siltation caused by agricultural practices . 

It can also be affected by coal ash spills , both directly by decreased swimming performance and indirectly by decreased energy resources available to it after release of coal ash into its environment . 

This being said , its range has declined in many states like Missouri , Arkansas , Ohio , and possibly even Tennessee .
