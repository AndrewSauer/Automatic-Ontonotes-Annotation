Solferino ( Upper Mantovano : ) is a small town and comune in the province of Mantua , Lombardy , northern Italy , approximately south of Lake Garda . 

It is best known as being close to the site of the Battle of Solferino on 24 June 1859 , part of the Second Italian War of Independence . 

The battle ended with Italo - French capture of the Rocca , the fortress then in Austrian hands . 

The wounded in the battle were witnessed by the Swiss businessman Jean - Henri Dunant , who had traveled to Italy to meet French emperor Napol√©on III with the intention of discussing difficulties in conducting business in Algeria , at that time occupied by France . 

Horrified by the suffering of wounded soldiers left on the battlefield , Dunant completely abandoned the original intent of his trip and for several days he devoted himself to helping with the treatment and care for the wounded . 

He succeeded in organizing an overwhelming level of relief assistance by motivating the local villagers to aid without discrimination . 

Back in his home in Geneva , he set about a process that led to the Geneva Conventions and the establishment of the International Committee of the Red Cross by writing a book entitled A Memory of Solferino which he published with his own money in 1862 and thus initiated the process . 

From 23 to 28 June 2009 , on the occasion of the 150th anniversary of the battle , a series of events gathering thousands of Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement volunteers from all around the world took place in Solferino , under the name of Solferino 2009 Celebrations .
