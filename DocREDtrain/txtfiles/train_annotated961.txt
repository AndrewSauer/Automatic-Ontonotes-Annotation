The Red Rover is a novel by American writer James Fenimore Cooper . 

It was originally published in Paris on November 27 , 1827 , before being published in London three days later on November 30 . 

It was not published in the United States until January 9 , 1828 , in Philadelphia . 

Soon after its publication it was adapted for theater both in the United States and in England . 

The novel follows the activities of the sailor Dick Fid , free black sailor Scipio Africanus and Royal Navy officer James Wilder as they encounter the famous pirate , " The Red Rover " . 

A contemporary reviewer in the North American Review noted how Cooper was particularly good at writing sea novels such as The Red Rover , the sea being his more natural element than what the author calls wilderness novels which focused on an Indian introducing a white man to the wilderness , like The Last of the Mohicans . 

In addition , The Red Rover presents some of the first serious depictions of characters of African lineage in American literature .
