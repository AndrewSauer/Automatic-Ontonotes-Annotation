Fort Sumter is a sea fort in Charleston , South Carolina , notable for two battles of the American Civil War . 

It was one of a number of special forts planned after the War of 1812 , combining high walls and heavy masonry , and classified as Third System , as a grade of structural integrity . 

Work started in 1829 , but was incomplete by 1860 , when South Carolina seceded from the Union . 

The First Battle of Fort Sumter began on April 12 , 1861 , when Confederate artillery fired on the Union garrison . 

These were the first shots of the war and continued all day , watched by many civilians in a celebratory spirit . 

The fort had been cut off from its supply line and surrendered the next day . 

The Second Battle of Fort Sumter ( September 8 , 1863 ) was a failed attempt by the Union to retake the fort , dogged by a rivalry between army and navy commanders . 

Although the fort was reduced to rubble , it remained in Confederate hands until it was evacuated as General Sherman marched through South Carolina in February 1865 . 

Fort Sumter is open for public tours as part of the Fort Sumter National Monument operated by the National Park Service .
