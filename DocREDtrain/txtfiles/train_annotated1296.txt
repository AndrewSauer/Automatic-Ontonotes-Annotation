Divinyls were an Australian rock band that was formed in Sydney in 1980 . 

The band primarily consisted of vocalist Chrissy Amphlett and guitarist Mark McEntee . 

Amphlett garnered widespread attention for performing on stage in a school uniform and fishnet stockings , and often used an illuminated neon tube as a prop for displaying aggression towards both band members and the audience . 

Originally a five - piece , the band underwent numerous line - up changes , with Amphlett and McEntee remaining as core members , before its dissolution in 1996 . 

In May 2001 , the Australasian Performing Right Association ( APRA ) , as part of its 75th - anniversary celebrations , named " Science Fiction " as one of the Top 30 Australian songs of all time . 

The band was inducted into the Australian Recording Industry Association ( ARIA ) Hall of Fame in 2006 and in late 2007 Amphlett and McEntee reconvened to record a new single and begin working on a new album . 

The band played a short series of live gigs in Australia in late 2007 and early 2008 .
