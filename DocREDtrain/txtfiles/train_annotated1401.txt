Zayed National Museum ( Arabic : متحف زايد الوطني ) is a planned museum , to be located in Abu Dhabi , UAE . 

It is designed as a memorial to the late Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan , the founding president of the UAE . 

The museum is planned to be the centrepiece of the Saadiyat Island Cultural District and will showcase the history , culture , and economic transformation of the Emirates . 

The museum has been designed by Foster + Partners with five solar thermal towers that will act as chimneys to draw cool air through the building . 

The towers are shaped like falcon wings to commemorate Zayed 's love of falconry . 

In 2009 , the Zayed Museum signed a ten - year contract with the British Museum . 

The British Museum would assist with curation and loan about 500 of its treasures to the Zayed Museum . 

The museum was projected for completion in 2016 , however , as of November 2017 , construction has not yet begun . 

According to The New York Times , the British Museum thinks that it is unlikely that any items will be loaned under the current contract , which ends in 2019 .
