The Committee on Judicial Accountability ( CJA ) is a group of lawyers in India who work to improve the accountability of judges . 

In 1998 the committee prepared a charge sheet to impeach Justice Madan Mohan Punchhi , and obtained the signatures of 25 Rajya Sabha MPs . 

However , Punchhi was appointed Chief Justice of India before the required 50 signatures had been obtained , at which point it became impossible to gain further support for the motion . 

The Committee on Judicial Accountability issued a highly critical report on the Judges Enquiry Bill , 2006 , saying of that bill that it " is going to reduce whatever little accountability of Judges remained under the present Judges Enquiry Act " . 

Anil B. Divan said " The aforementioned new bill is worse than the old Judges Inquiry Act and it needs to be scrapped in toto . 

This new bill is nothing but a sham " . 

In December 2009 the CJA stated that it considered that recommendations for judicial appointments should only be made after a public debate , including review by members of the bar of the affected high courts . 

This statement was made in relation to controversy about the appointments of justices C. K. Prasad and P. D. Dinakaran . 

The statement was signed by Ram Jethmalani , Shanti Bhushan , Fali Sam Nariman , Anil B. Divan , Kamini Jaiswal and Prashant Bhushan . 

Prashant Bhushan is also the convenor of the Working Committee of the Campaign for Judicial Accountability and Judicial Reforms .
