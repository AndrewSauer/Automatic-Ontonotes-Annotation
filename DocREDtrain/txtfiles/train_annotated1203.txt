It supported for the 1958 presidential election the candidacy of Jorge Alessandri and participated , along with the Liberal Party and supporters of former president Carlos Ib치침ez del Campo , in its government . 

In 1962 , it participated in the Democratic Front of Chile center - right coalition which opposed the left - wings FRAP coalition and supported for the 1964 presidential election Eduardo Frei Montalva ( who obtained less than 56 % of the votes ) .
