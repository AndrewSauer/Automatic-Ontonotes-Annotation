Originally named Democratic Socialist Movement of France ( Mouvement démocrate socialiste de France , MDSF ) , the party was founded in 1973 , by a split from the Socialist Party ( PS ) . 

Its founders ( among them Max Lejeune , André Santini , Pierre - Cristophe Baguet , Charles Baur , Émile Muller , Joseph Klifa and Auguste Locoeur ) opposed to the alliance with the French Communist Party ( PCF ) arranged by François Mitterrand on behalf of the PS based on the Common Programme . 

In 1978 , the PSD joined the Union for French Democracy ( UDF ) , the centre - right confederation created in order to support President Valéry Giscard d'Estaing . 

In 1995 , the PSD merged with the Centre of Social Democrats ( CDS ) , the Christian - democratic component of the confederation , to form Democratic Force ( FD ) , which later became the core of a unified UDF in 1998 .
