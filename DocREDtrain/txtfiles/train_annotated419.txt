Ottaviano de ' Medici ( 11 July 1484 â€“ 28 May 1546 ) was an Italian politician . 

He was the ancestor of the Princes of Ottajano line of the Medici family . 

From a minor branch of the Medici family , he gained prominence through his marriage to Francesca Salviati , a granddaughter of Lorenzo de ' Medici and Ottaviano 's own distant cousin . 

He held several important positions in Florence , including that of Gonfaloniere di Giustizia , although now a merely formal one after the suppression of the Republic by the Spanish troops in 1530 . 

He was also Senator from 1532 . 

He was trusted by Alessandro de ' Medici with administrating the family 's Tuscan estates . 

His son Alessandro was cardinal and , from 1605 , pope as Leo XI . 

His other son Bernadetto founded the southern Italian line of the family by acquiring the seigniory of Ottaviano , near Naples .
