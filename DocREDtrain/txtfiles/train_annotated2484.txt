The Constitution of the Philippines ( Filipino : Saligang Batas ng Pilipinas or Konstitusyon ng Pilipinas ) is the constitution or supreme law of the Republic of the Philippines . 

Its final draft was completed by the Constitutional Commission on October 12 , 1986 and was ratified by a nationwide plebiscite on February 2 , 1987 . 

Three other constitutions have effectively governed the country in its history : the 1935 Commonwealth Constitution , the 1973 Constitution , and the 1986 Freedom Constitution . 

The earliest constitution establishing a " Philippine Republic , " the 1899 Malolos Constitution , was never fully implemented throughout the Philippines and did not establish a state that was internationally recognized , due in great part to the ongoing American invasion during the time of its adoption .
