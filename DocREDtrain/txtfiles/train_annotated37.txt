Bartolomeo Altomonte , also known as Bartholomäus Hohenberg ( 24 February 1694 , in Warsaw – 11 November 1783 , in Sankt Florian ) , was an Austrian baroque painter who specialized in large scale frescoes . 

He was the son of Martino Altomonte , also a painter . 

Altomonte was born in Warsaw , where his father , Martino Altomonte , had been appointed to the court of Jan Sobieskis . 

He was the third of six children . 

Altomonte spent most of his life in Linz and worked primarily in Austrian monasteries such as St. Florian 's Priory and Admont Abbey . 

He learned from assisting his father at painting , but also from an apprenticeship with Daniel Gran . 

Tendencies towards the rococo remained foreign to the artist all his life ; he is considered one of the last great painters in the manner of the baroque allegory .
