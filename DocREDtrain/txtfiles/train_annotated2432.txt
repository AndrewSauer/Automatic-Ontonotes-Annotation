The Love , Death & Mussolini E.P. 

was a cassette released by Steven Wilson under the pseudonym of ' Porcupine Tree ' . 

It compiles a total of nine tracks of which seven were shortly after released in The Nostalgia Factory . 

The song " Out " was later included on the vinyl edition of the compilation album Yellow Hedgerow Dreamscape and the 2013 CD remaster of the album . 

" It Will Rain for a Million Years " shares its name with a track in On the Sunday of Life ... but is a totally different song and is elsewhere unavailable . 

Love , Death & Mussolini was limited to only 10 copies so it is nearly impossible to obtain . 

According to Steven Wilson himself , he does n't have a copy of the album . 

Many of the lyrics on Love , Death & Mussolini were written by Alan Duffy and given to Wilson as a gift . 

The inlay of the sleeve contains credits to some musicians of which only JC Camillioni is an existing person , all of the rest are fictitious band members created by Wilson . 

The album came with a booklet that had a mocking message explaining why the Love , Death & Mussolini EP is in fact an LP , descriptions of the songs and a catalogue .
