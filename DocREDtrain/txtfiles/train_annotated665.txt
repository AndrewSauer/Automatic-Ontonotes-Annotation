The Bang Bang Club was a group of four conflict photographers active within the townships of South Africa between 1990 and 1994 , during the transition from the apartheid system to democracy . 

This period included much factional violence , particularly fighting between ANC and IFP supporters , after the lifting of the bans on both political parties . 

The Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging and other groups were also involved in the violence . 

Kevin Carter , Greg Marinovich , Ken Oosterbroek , and Jo√£o Silva were the four associated with the name . 

Many photographers , photojournalists , ( such as James Nachtwey and Gary Bernard ) and television news crews reported also at this time the violence in the townships . 

A movie about the group , directed by Steven Silver premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival in 2010 .
