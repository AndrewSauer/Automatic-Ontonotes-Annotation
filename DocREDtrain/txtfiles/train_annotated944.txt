" There 's the Girl " is a song recorded by the American rock band , Heart . 

It was composed by Holly Knight and Heart band member Nancy Wilson . 

" There 's The Girl " was released in a remixed version as the third single from Heart 's ninth studio album , Bad Animals . 

Knight is known as a very successful songwriter who was responsible for penning many hit singles during the 1980s . 

Like Heart 's 1986 # 1 single " These Dreams " , the lead vocals on " There 's the Girl " were performed by Nancy Wilson , rather than Ann Wilson ( though most fans did not realize this until the video was released or they saw the song performed live ) , the usual lead singer for the group . 

The single climbed to # 12 on the U.S. 

Billboard Hot 100 and was also a Top-40 single on the UK Singles Chart , where it peaked at # 34 .
