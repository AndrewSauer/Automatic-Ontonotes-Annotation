" Luv Your Life " is the third single by Australian rock band Silverchair from their fourth album Diorama , which was released in 2002 . 

The song was released as a single and a video was made in which the band was portrayed as animated characters . 

This is mostly because Daniel Johns was incapacitated by his reactive arthritis , and the band needed to release another song to prevent commercial momentum for the album to come to a complete halt . 

When watching the video , one can see that Chris and Ben 's animated characters seem to be more fluid and realistic than Daniel 's . 

This may be due to Chris and Ben doing some sort of motion capture for the making of the video . 

Chris stated that this song is his favourite off the album . 

" Luv Your Life " was dedicated by Johns to " all my ladies " , and was written on piano and featured an orchestral arrangement by Van Dyke Parks . 

The single peaked at number Â  20 on the Australian Recording Industry Association Singles Chart .
