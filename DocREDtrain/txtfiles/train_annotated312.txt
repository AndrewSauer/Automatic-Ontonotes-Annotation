Hydrozagadka ( ) is a Polish superhero comedy film . 

During a summer heat wave , all the water in Warsaw is puzzlingly disappearing . 

Scientists secretly call upon As ( Ace ) , a superhero who passes his days living as a mild - mannered engineer , to try to solve the mystery . 

It turns out that a mystery Maharaja is in league with Doctor Spot to steal Poland 's water and take it to the Maharaja 's country . 

The movie was ostensibly created as a Communist parody of the American ideals glorified in Superman and other superhero films , however Polish audiences instead felt that the film humorously parodied aspects of Polish life under Communist rule , such as the many slogans for a " better life . " 

Hydrozagadka premiered on 30 April 1971 on Polish television .
