Farmstead cheese , less commonly known as farmhouse cheese , is produced from the milk collected on the same farm where the cheese is produced . 

Unlike artisan cheese , which may also include milk purchased and transported from off - farm sources , farmstead cheese makers only use milk from animals they raise . 

According to the American Cheese Society , " milk used in the production of farmstead cheeses may not be obtained from any outside source " . 

As a result , the cheeses produced often have unique flavors owing to the farm 's local terroir . 

Most farmstead cheese is produced from cow , goat or sheep milk , although some farmstead cheeses are produced from water buffalo milk ( mainly Buffalo mozzarella ) . 

Farmstead cheeses are most often made on family farms in small batches and is often sold at local farmers ' markets . 

While Europe has long had a very strong tradition of farmstead cheese - making , it is only in the last decades of the 20th century that farmstead cheese - making began to return to prominence in North America . 

In the United States , the top states for farmstead cheesmaking include Vermont , California , and Wisconsin , although farmstead cheese is growing rapidly in other states , like Georgia , as well . 

North Carolina is another state that has recently gained accolades for its farmstead cheeses , even creating the WNC Cheese Trail .
