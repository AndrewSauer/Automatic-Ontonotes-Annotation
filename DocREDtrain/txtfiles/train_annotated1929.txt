" Walk Away Renée " is a song written by Michael Brown , Bob Calilli , and Tony Sansone for the band the Left Banke , released as a single in July 1966 . 

Steve Martin Caro is featured on lead vocals . 

It spent 13 weeks on the US charts , with a top spot of number 5 . 

The song features a flute solo played during the instrumental bridge of the middle portion of the song . 

Brown got the idea for the flute solo from the Mamas & the Papas song " California Dreamin ' " which had been recorded in November 1965 but was n't a hit and in heavy rotation until early 1966 . 

The arrangement also includes a lush string orchestration , a jangling harpsichord part , and a descending chromatic bass melody . 

Its production was credited to World United Productions , Inc. , but the session was produced by Brown 's father , jazz and classical violinist Harry Lookofsky , who also led the string players . 

Rolling Stone placed " Walk Away Renée " at number 220 in the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time . 

The song returned to nationwide charts with cover versions by The Four Tops ( 1967 ) and Rick Price ( 1993 ) .
