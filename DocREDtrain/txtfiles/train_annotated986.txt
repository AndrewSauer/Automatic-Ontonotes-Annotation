KeyBank Pavilion ( originally Coca - Cola Star Lake Amphitheater ) is an outdoor amphitheater in Burgettstown , Pennsylvania , United States , 25 miles west of Pittsburgh . 

The venue holds approximately 23,000 fans : 7,100 in a reserved - seating , open - air pavilion and an additional 16,000 on a general - admission lawn . 

It is owned and operated by Live Nation . 

The venue opened as Coca - Cola Star Lake Amphitheater and hosted its first national act , Billy Joel , on June 17 , 1990 . 

A second show was added on June 18 , 1990 due to the record - breaking response . 

Since then , it has hosted many other " big - name " concerts . 

In 2000 , the name of the venue was changed to the Post - Gazette Pavilion after the Pittsburgh Post - Gazette bought the naming rights . 

In February 2010 , the publication announced it had not renewed its contract for naming rights to the facility , leading to First Niagara Bank to snatch up the naming rights . 

The facility was renamed again in 2016 after KeyCorp finished its acquisition of First Niagara . 

The facility has lost some business since the 2010 opening of Stage AE , which is located within the city of Pittsburgh on the North Shore next to Heinz Field .
