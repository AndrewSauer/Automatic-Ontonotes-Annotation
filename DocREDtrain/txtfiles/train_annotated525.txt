The Morean War ( ) is the better - known name for the Sixth Ottoman – Venetian War . 

The war was fought between 1684 – 1699 , as part of the wider conflict known as the " Great Turkish War " , between the Republic of Venice and the Ottoman Empire . 

Military operations ranged from Dalmatia to the Aegean Sea , but the war 's major campaign was the Venetian conquest of the Morea ( Peloponnese ) peninsula in southern Greece . 

On the Venetian side , the war was fought to avenge the loss of Crete in the Cretan War ( 1645 – 1669 ) , while the Ottomans were entangled in their northern frontier against the Habsburgs and were unable to concentrate their forces against the Republic . 

As such , the Morean War holds the distinction of being the only Ottoman – Venetian conflict from which Venice emerged victorious , gaining significant territory . 

Venice 's expansionist revival would be short - lived however , as its gains would be reversed by the Ottomans in 1718 .
