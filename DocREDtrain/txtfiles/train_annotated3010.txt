Russian neoclassical revival was a trend in Russian culture , mostly pronounced in architecture , that briefly replaced eclecticism and Art Nouveau as the leading architectural style between the Revolution of 1905 and the outbreak of World War I , coexisting with the Silver Age of Russian Poetry . 

It is characterized by merger of new technologies ( steel frame and reinforced concrete ) with moderate application of classical order and the legacy of Russian empire style of the first quarter of the 19th century . 

Revival school was most active in Saint Petersburg , less in Moscow and other cities . 

The style was a common choice for luxury country estates , upper - class apartment and office buildings ; at the same time it was practically non - existent in church and government architecture . 

Neoclassical architects born in the 1870s , who reached their peak activity in 1905 - 1914 ( Ivan Fomin , Vladimir Shchuko , Ivan Zholtovsky ) , later became leading figures in stalinist architecture of the 1930s and shaped Soviet architectural education system .
