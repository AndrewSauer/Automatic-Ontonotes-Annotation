KMYU , virtual channel 12 ( VHF digital channel 9 ) , is a primary MyNetworkTV - affiliated television station licensed to St. George , Utah , United States . 

The station is owned by Sinclair Broadcast Group , as part of a triopoly with Salt Lake City - based CBS affiliate KUTV ( channel 2 ) and independent station KJZZ - TV ( channel 14 ) . 

The three stations share studios on South Main Street in downtown Salt Lake City ; KMYU 's transmitter is located atop Webb Hill , south of downtown St. George . 

For official FCC purposes regarding a studio location in its city of license , KMYU has its studios in the J.C. 

Snow Building on East St. George Boulevard in downtown St. George , which also serves as KUTV 's southern Utah news bureau . 

As the broadcasting radius of KMYU 's signal from St. George does not reach Salt Lake City due to its transmitter being located in the southern portion of the state , the station is simulcast in high definition over KUTV 's second digital subchannel in order to reach that portion of the market , airing on virtual channel 2.2 from KUTV 's transmitter located at Farnsworth Peak in the Oquirrh Mountains , southwest of Salt Lake City ; similarly , because of the location of KUTV 's transmitter , KMYU relays that station 's signal in high definition on its second digital subchannel to provide over - the - air coverage of KUTV 's CBS service to St. George . 

Many of KUTV 's statewide digital translator stations also distribute both KUTV and the KMYU 2.2 simulcast to the northern and eastern portions of the state .
