It reached number 6 in the UK Singles Chart . 

The song was not featured on one of Morrissey 's main studio albums , but can be found on the compilation album Bona Drag along with the B - side " Lucky Lisp " . 

The artwork for the single features Morrissey , aged 7 , up a tree in Chorlton - on - Medlock , Manchester — literally a boy at play . 

" The Last of the Famous International Playboys " is notable for featuring three of Morrissey 's former colleagues in The Smiths — Andy Rourke , Mike Joyce and one - time Smiths rhythm guitarist Craig Gannon — all of whom also appear on the B - side , " Lucky Lisp " .
