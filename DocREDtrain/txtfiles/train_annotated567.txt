The Vega program ( Cyrillic : ВеГа ) was a series of Venus missions that also took advantage of the appearance of comet 1P / Halley in 1986 . 

Vega 1 and Vega 2 were unmanned spacecraft launched in a cooperative effort among the Soviet Union ( who provided the spacecraft and launch vehicle ) and Austria , Bulgaria , France , Hungary , the German Democratic Republic , Poland , Czechoslovakia and the Federal Republic of Germany in December 1984 . 

They had a two - part mission to investigate Venus and also flyby Halley 's Comet . 

The flyby of Halley 's Comet had been a late mission change in the Venera program following on from the cancellation of the American Halley mission in 1981 . 

A later Venera mission was cancelled and the Venus part of the Vega 1 mission was reduced . 

Because of this , the craft was designated VeGa , a contraction of Venera and Gallei ( Венера and Галлея respectively , the Russian words for " Venus " and " Halley " ) . 

The spacecraft design was based on the previous Venera 9 and Venera 10 missions . 

The two spacecraft were launched on December 15 and 21 , 1984 , respectively . 

With their redesignated dual missions , the Vega probes became part of the Halley Armada , a group of space probes that studied Halley 's Comet during its 1985/1986 perihelion .
