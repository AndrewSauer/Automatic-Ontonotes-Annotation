The Monroe â€“ Pinkney Treaty of 1806 was a treaty drawn up by diplomats of the United States and Britain as a renewal of the Jay Treaty of 1795 . 

It was rejected by President Thomas Jefferson and never took effect . 

The treaty was negotiated by minister to England James Monroe and his associate William Pinkney on behalf of the administration of President Thomas Jefferson , and Lord Holland and Lord Auckland on behalf of the " Ministry of All the Talents " government headed by Lord Grenville . 

For the Americans , the goal of the treaty was to make the British abandon the practice of impressing sailors from American ships , as well as to address the neutral trading rights of American vessels in the ongoing Napoleonic Wars , among other commercial concerns . 

However , the British were short of manpower for the Royal Navy and believed that many British deserters were serving on American ships . 

In the desperate war against Napoleon , the British believed that they could not afford to abandon impressment : offending the Americans was seen as a much lesser evil than losing to Napoleon . 

Therefore , no concessions on the issue of impressment were made . 

The negotiations were begun on 27 August 1806 , and the treaty was signed on 31 December , 1806 . 

President Jefferson received the treaty in March 1807 , but was disappointed and refused to submit it to the Senate for ratification . 

This failure to resolve differences over the issue of impressment and neutral trading rights contributed to the coming of the War of 1812 .
