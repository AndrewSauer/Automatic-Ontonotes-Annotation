The Franklin – Nashville Campaign , also known as Hood 's Tennessee Campaign , was a series of battles in the Western Theater , conducted from September 18 to December 27 , 1864 , in Alabama , Tennessee , and northwestern Georgia during the American Civil War . 

The Confederate Army of Tennessee under Lt . Gen. John Bell Hood drove north from Atlanta , threatening Maj . Gen. William T. Sherman 's lines of communications and central Tennessee . 

After a brief attempt to pursue Hood , Sherman returned to Atlanta and began his March to the Sea , leaving Union forces under Maj . Gen. George H. Thomas to deal with Hood 's threat . 

Hood hoped to defeat the Union force under Maj . Gen. John Schofield before it could converge with Thomas 's army and attempted to do so at the Battle of Spring Hill on November 29 , but poorly coordinated Confederate attacks allowed Schofield to escape . 

The following day , Hood launched a series of futile frontal assaults against Schofield 's field fortifications in the Battle of Franklin , suffering heavy casualties ; Schofield withdrew his force and successfully linked up with Thomas in Nashville , Tennessee . 

On December 15–16 , Thomas 's combined army attacked Hood 's depleted army and routed it in the Battle of Nashville , sending it in retreat to Tupelo , Mississippi . 

Hood resigned his commission shortly thereafter and the Army of Tennessee ceased to exist as an effective fighting force .
