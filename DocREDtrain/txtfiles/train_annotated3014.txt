The Looting of Battleford began at the end of March , 1885 , during the North - West Rebellion , in the town of Battleford , Saskatchewan , then a part of the Northwest Territories . 

Within days of the Métis victory at the Battle of Duck Lake on March 26 , 1885 . 

Cree bands sympathetic to the Métis cause and with grievances of their own began raiding stores and farms in the western part of the District of Saskatchewan for arms , ammunition and food supplies while civilians fled to the larger settlements and forts of the North - West Territories . 

Prominent leaders of this uprising were Chief Poundmaker and Chief Big Bear . 

Poundmaker and his band had a reserve near present - day Cut Knife about 50   km ( 31 miles ) west of Fort Battleford . 

Big Bear and his band had settled near Frog Lake about 55   km ( 34 miles ) northwest of Fort Pitt but had not yet selected a reserve site . 

Both bands were signatories of Treaty 6 and were unhappy in the way it was implemented by the Canadian government . 

The loss of the buffalo and the inadequate rations provided by the Indian agents kept the bands in a continual state of near - starvation .
