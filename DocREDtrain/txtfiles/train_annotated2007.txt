Lappkärret is a small lake in Norra Djurgården in north - eastern Stockholm , Sweden , near Stockholm University . 

It is one of six lakes in Djurgården , the others being : Lillsjön , Uggleviken , Isbladskärret , Laduviken , and Spegeldammen . 

Through its location in the Royal National City Park , it is considered as a lake of great recreational value , especially popular among ornithologists and frequently used in classes at the University of Stockholm located nearby . 

As the name implies , it used to be a marsh until construction works for the student apartments at Lappkärrsberget punctured a subsoil spring in the 1960s . 

Today , the lake empties into the strait Lilla Värtan through a culvert and forms part of a proposed nature reserve in Norra Djurgården .
