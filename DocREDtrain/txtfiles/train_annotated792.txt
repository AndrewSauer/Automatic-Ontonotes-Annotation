Jeff Davis ( born Jefferson Davis ; May 6 , 1862 â€“ January 3 , 1913 ) was a Democratic politician who served as the 20th Governor of Arkansas from 1901 to 1907 and in the United States Senate from 1907 to 1913 . 

He took office as one of Arkansas 's first New South governors and proved to be one of the state 's most polarizing figures . 

Davis used his silver tongue and aptitude for demagoguery to exploit existing feelings of agrarian frustration among poor rural white farmers and thus build a large populist appeal . 

However , since Davis often blamed city - dwellers , blacks and Yankees for problems on the farm , the state was quickly and ardently split into " pro - Davis " or " anti - Davis " factions . 

Davis began his political career as Arkansas Attorney General , where he immediately began making political waves . 

His office challenged the legality of the Kimball State House Act and made an extremely controversial extraterritorial interpretation of the Rector Antitrust Act . 

His fight to prevent trusts from doing business in Arkansas and the extreme lengths he went to enforce his opinion would be a common theme throughout his political career . 

He gained credibility among the poor rural whites who would become his base . 

Davis ' three two - year terms as Arkansas Governor " produced more politics than government " , but he did gain construction of a new state house and reformed the penal system . 

An almost - constant series of scandals and outrageous behavior characterized his time in office , which followed him when he won election to the United States Senate in 1906 . 

Davis is often classified with such populist politicians as Benjamin Tillman , Robert Love Taylor , Thomas E. Watson , James K. Vardaman , Coleman Livingston Blease , and later Huey Long , controversial figures known as part - Southern demagogues , part - populists and part - political bosses .
