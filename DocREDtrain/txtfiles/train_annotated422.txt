The Verziere ( old - fashioned Italian word for " greengrocery market " ; also known as Verzee , in Milanese ) was the traditional greengrocery street market of Milan , Italy . 

The market itself has been relocated several times , and it is now in Via Lombroso , east of the city centre ; the word " Verziere " , anyway , still refers to the main historic location of the market , where it was held from 1776 century until 1911 . 

The new greengrocery market of Via Lombroso is more properly referred to as " Ortomercato " ( another Italian word with the same meaning ) or " Mercati Generali " ( " general markets " ) . 

The " Verziere " area has been a symbol of Milan , and notable Milanese scholars such as Carlo Porta and Carlo Maria Maggi celebrated the Verziere in their works as the place where both the Milanese dialect and the Milanese culture was represented in their purest form .
