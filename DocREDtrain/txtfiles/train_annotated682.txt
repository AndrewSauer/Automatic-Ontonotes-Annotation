" Vital Signs " is a song by progressive rock trio Rush from their album Moving Pictures . 

The lyrics of the song are about individuality and the pressures of conforming . 

The song is heavily influenced by reggae ( in the guitar riff ) as well as progressive electronica ( in its use of sequencers ) and the music of The Police . 

These influences would carry on into their next three studio albums : Signals , Grace Under Pressure , and Power Windows . 

The song was released as the final single from the Moving Pictures album . 

Also , a live version of " Vital Signs " appeared as the B - side to Rush 's " New World Man " single in 1982 ( Mercury # 76179 , US edition ) . 

It has appeared in Rush 's set lists as recently as the 2010 - 2011 Time Machine Tour ( documented on ) , during which Moving Pictures was played in its entirety .
