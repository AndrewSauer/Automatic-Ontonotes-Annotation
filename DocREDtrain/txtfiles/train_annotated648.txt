Teatrul Evreiesc de Stat ( TES , the State Jewish Theater ) in Bucharest , Romania is a theater specializing in Jewish - related plays . 

It is the oldest Yiddish - language theater with uninterrupted activity in the world . 

Its contemporary repertoire includes plays by Jewish authors , plays on Jewish topics , and plays in Yiddish ( which are performed with simultaneous translation into Romanian , using headphones installed in the theater in the 1970s ) . 

Many of the plays also feature Jewish actors . 

A precursor , the Teatru Evreiesc Bara≈üeum operated as a Jewish theater through most of World War II , although they were closed during the few months of the National Legionary State , and thereafter performed in Romanian rather than Yiddish through until the fall of Ion Antonescu .
