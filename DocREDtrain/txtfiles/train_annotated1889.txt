The Vaal Triangle is a triangular area formed by Vereeniging , Vanderbijlpark and Sasolburg - together they comprise a substantial urban complex in South Africa about 60   km south of Johannesburg . 

Meyerton , just north of Vereeniging , is also generally included in the complex , and residents of Sharpeville , Boipatong , Bophelong , the greater Sebokeng area ( includingEvaton , Orange Farm , etc . 

) , Heidelberg , Zamdela,((Deneysville ) ) and Potchefstroom also generally tend to consider themselves to live in the Vaal Triangle . 

The area straddles the Vaal River and is a major industrial region , which is home to former Iron and Steel Corporation Iscor , now ArcelorMittal South Africa and Sasol , the steel and oil - from - coal processing facilities . 

Due to the heavy industries in and around the Vaal Triangle it became infamous for its air pollution and respiratory disease . 

For this reason , local Afrikaans speaking people often refer to the region as the Vuil Driehoek ( meaning Dirty Triangle ) as a pun on Vaal Driehoek ( the Afrikaans translation for Vaal Triangle ) . 

Nearby is the Vaal Dam , from which the massive PWV megalopolis ( Pretoria , Witwatersrand and Vereeniging ) draws its water . 

The PWV forms the urban heart of Gauteng province . 

The Witwatersrand is the name given to the area that comprises the Greater Johannesburg metropole and the gold - bearing reef along which gold was discovered in 1886 . 

The Vaal Dam is well - patronised by people from Johannesburg over the weekends and during holidays , as it provides extensive water recreation facilities some 70   km south of the city .
