The New Market Wizards is a book by Jack D. Schwager published on January 26 , 1992 by HarperCollins . 

The format is very similar to his 1988 Market Wizards , with a new selection of interviews with super - traders . 

As in the previous volume , Schwager starts with a frank discussion of his own trading experience , followed by a surprising diversion comparing Saddam Hussein 's invasion of Kuwait with a trade that went wrong . 

The rest of the book is broken into five parts including interviews with different types of traders and brief discussions of the lessons to be learnt from them , plus a part on trading psychology and a final part summarising the wisdom gained from all of the interviewees in 42 golden rules .
