Novoryazanskaya Street Garage , also spelled Novo - Ryazanskaya Street Garage , and known as " Horseshoe garage " , was designed by Konstantin Melnikov and Vladimir Shukhov ( structural engineering ) in 1926 and completed in 1929 at 27 , Novoryazanskaya Street in Krasnoselsky District , Moscow , Russia , near Kazansky Rail Terminal . 

The main building of this truck garage has a semi - circular form , with service workshops and office in a standalone building between the tips of a " horseshoe " . 

Each of two levels could store 110 trucks ; unlike Bakhmetevsky Bus Garage , these had to be parked conventionally , using reverse gear . 

Each tip of the horseshoe has a V - shaped protrusion with entry and exit gates set at an angle to the street line ; this was supposed to simplify entry and exit from a narrow street . 

This garage is still used as such , and houses Moscow 's Fourth Bus Park . 

However , since modern articulated buses are longer than 1920s trucks , present - day parking arrangement differs from Melnikov 's efficient layout .
