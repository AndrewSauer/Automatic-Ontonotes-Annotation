Café Guerbois , on Avenue de Clichy in Paris , was the site of late 19th - century discussions and planning amongst artists , writers and art lovers   – the bohèmes ( bohemians ) , in contrast to the bourgeois . 

Centered on Édouard Manet , the group gathered at the café usually on Sundays and Thursdays . 

Émile Zola , Frédéric Bazille , Louis Edmond Duranty , Henri Fantin - Latour , Edgar Degas , Claude Monet , Pierre - Auguste Renoir and Alfred Sisley regularly joined in the discussions . 

Sometimes Paul Cézanne and Camille Pissarro also joined them . 

The group is sometimes called The Batignolles Group , and many of the members are associated with Impressionism . 

Conversations there were often heated . 

On one evening in February 1870 , things became so heated that Manet , insulted by a review that Duranty wrote , wounded Duranty in a duel . 

The injury was not fatal , and the two remained friends .
