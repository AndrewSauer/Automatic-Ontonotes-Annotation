The Astures or Asturs , also named Astyrs , were the Hispano - Celtic inhabitants of the northwest area of Hispania that now comprises almost the entire modern autonomous community of Principality of Asturias , the modern province of León , and the northern part of the modern province of Zamora ( all in Spain ) , and east of Trás os Montes in Portugal . 

They were a horse - riding highland cattle - raising people who lived in circular huts of stone drywall construction . 

The Albiones were a major tribe from western Asturias . 

Isidore of Seville gave an etymology as coming from a river Asturia , identified by David Magie with Órbigo river in the plain of León , by others the modern Esla river .
