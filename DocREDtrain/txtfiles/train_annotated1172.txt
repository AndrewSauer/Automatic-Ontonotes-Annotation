Spacemonkeyz are a musical group consisting of Darren Galea , Richie Stevens and Gavin Dodds . 

They came together when Galea created a dub remix of Gorillaz 's " Tomorrow Comes Today " ( " Tomorrow Dub " , which was released as a B - side on the " Tomorrow Comes Today " single ) , which Gorillaz founder Damon Albarn liked so much that he asked Galea to remix the whole album Gorillaz . 

The resulting album , Laika Come Home , was released in July 2002 . 

The album 's first and only single " Lil ' Dub Chefin ' " reached # 73 on the UK Singles Chart . 

They also wrote an original song with Taiwanese singer Stanley Huang , " Spacemonkeyz Theme " , which appeared as a B - side on " Lil ' Dub Chefin ' " , and did a remix of the Herbert Gr√∂nemeyer single " Mensch " . 

Darren Galea performed turntables as part of the Gorillaz live band on all of the ' Gorillaz ' & ' Demon Days ' Live dates between 2000 and 2006 . 

Like the Gorillaz , they are a virtual band ( though not to the degree that Gorillaz are ) . 

According to the fictional Gorillaz biography Rise of the Ogre , the group is an actual team of monkeys used in space tests who had stolen the tracks from an unattended Kong Studios and remixed them without Gorillaz 's permission . 

Since the release of Laika Come Home the band has not released any new material . 

On the Hallelujah Monkeyz podcast Richie Stevens announced that new Spacemonkeyz material will be releasing soon .
