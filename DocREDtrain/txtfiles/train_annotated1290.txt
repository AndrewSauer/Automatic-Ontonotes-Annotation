Bur Dubai ( in Arabic : بر دبي ) is a historic district in Dubai , United Arab Emirates , located on the western side of the Dubai Creek . 

The name literally translates to Mainland Dubai , a reference to the traditional separation of the Bur Dubai area from Deira by the Dubai Creek . 

This is because Bur Dubai historically consisted of all districts between the western bank of the Creek and Jumeirah . 

The Ruler 's Court is located in the district adjacent to the Grand Mosque . 

The district is home to several mosques including the Grand Mosque with the city 's tallest minaret , and the blue tiled Iranian Mosque . 

The country 's only Hindu temple is situated between the Grand Mosque and the Creek . 

It is home to several popular places for tourists including renovated historic buildings and museums . 

The district has many shopping streets and souqs ( or souk ) , including the textile souq near the abra boat station , though most of the well known souqs are located in Deira .
