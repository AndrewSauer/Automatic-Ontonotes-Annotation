Prince Frederick , Duke of York and Albany ( Frederick Augustus ; 16 August 1763 – 5 January 1827 ) was the second son of George III , King of the United Kingdom and Hanover , and his consort Charlotte of Mecklenburg - Strelitz . 

A soldier by profession , from 1764 to 1803 he was Prince - Bishop of Osnabrück in the Holy Roman Empire . 

From the death of his father in 1820 until his own death in 1827 he was the heir presumptive to his elder brother , George IV , in both the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and the Kingdom of Hanover . 

Frederick was thrust into the British Army at a very early age and was appointed to high command at the age of thirty , when he was given command of a notoriously ineffectual campaign during the War of the First Coalition , a continental war following the French Revolution . 

Later , as Commander - in - Chief during the Napoleonic Wars , he oversaw the reorganisation of the British Army , establishing vital structural , administrative and recruiting reforms for which he is credited with having done " more for the army than any one man has done for it in the whole of its history .
