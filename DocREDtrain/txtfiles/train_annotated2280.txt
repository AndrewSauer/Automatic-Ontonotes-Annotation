Monster House was an Australian reality / comedy television series broadcast on the Nine Network . 

Debuting on 12 February 2008 , the program was hosted by Bernard Curry , brother of Stephen and Andrew Curry . 

The show centred on the Webb family , played by actors Rebel Wilson , Celia Ireland , Travis Cotton , Jody Kennedy , Julie Herbert and Glenn Butcher , who act as a fictional family in a house purpose - built with hidden cameras to capture their performances and those of the unsuspecting guests who get brought into the family 's " web " . 

The show debuted with an unimpressive 793,000 viewers tuning in . 

It was pulled from schedules after its second episode , and axed by the network the following day . 

Nine had commissioned ten unaired episodes of the show , which were filmed in December 2007 and January 2008 . 

Nine stated it would air the remaining episodes later in the year , and did so as counter - programming during the 2008 Summer Olympics .
