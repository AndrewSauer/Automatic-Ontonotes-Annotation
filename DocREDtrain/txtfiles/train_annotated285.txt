The Imperial Valley lies in California 's Imperial County . 

It is located in southeastern Southern California , and is the site of an urban area largely centered on the city of El Centro . 

The Valley is bordered by the Colorado River to the east and , in part , the Salton Sea to the west . 

Farther west lies the San Diego and Imperial County border . 

To the north is the Coachella Valley region of Riverside County , which together with Imperial Valley form the Salton Trough , or the Cahuilla Basin , also the county line of Imperial and Riverside counties , and to the south the international boundary with the U.S. state of California and Baja California . 

The culture of the area blends those of the United States and Mexico , due to its regional history and geographic location along the international border . 

The Imperial Valley economy is based on agriculture . 

Imperial Valley was so named by the Imperial Land Company , in hopes of attracting settlers .
