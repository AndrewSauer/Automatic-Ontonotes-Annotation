High Park was a provincial electoral district in the west - end of the old City of Toronto , Ontario , Canada . 

It was represented in the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 1926 to 1975 . 

It was mostly redistributed into the High Park — Swansea electoral district for the 1975 Ontario general election . 

The High Park provincial electoral district was notable for its electors defeating the incumbent Premier , and their Member of Provincial Parliament , George Drew , in the 1948 provincial election . 

He lost his seat over the issue of temperance ; even though his Conservatives were returned with a majority government . 

The old City of West Toronto Junction had been an alcohol - free area since even before it was annexed by Toronto back in 1909 , and those " dry - laws " were still current at the time of the 1948 election . 

So when Drew 's government passed a new law that allowed " cocktail bars " to open in the province , his local constituents were not pleased , allowing the aptly named temperance candidate , " Temperance Bill " Temple of the Ontario Co - operative Commonwealth Federation to win . 

The provincial riding had a number of colourful Members of Provincial Parliament ( MPPs ) including Drew , and his successor William Horace Temple as well as the district 's final representative , Doctor Morton Shulman . 

The district was abolished during the 1975 redistribution , placing most of it in the new High Park — Swansea district . 

As of 2013 , the territory it represented belongs in the current Parkdale — High Park , York South — Weston and Davenport districts .
