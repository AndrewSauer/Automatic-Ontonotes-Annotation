Matthew Hale Carpenter ( born Decatur Merritt Hammond Carpenter ; December 22 , 1824 â€“ February 24 , 1881 ) was an American attorney and U.S. 

Senator representing the state of Wisconsin . 

He served in the Senate from 1869 to 1875 and again from 1879 to 1881 . 

Recognized as an authority on constitutional law , he made some of the most important legal arguments of 19th - century America . 

Carpenter presented cases before the U. S. Supreme Court involving such matters as states ' rights and regulation of corporations . 

Originally a Democrat , he evolved into a Republican during the Civil War , and helped perpetuate the party 's political machinery in Wisconsin . 

His sustained support for President Ulysses S. Grant 's administration despite allegations of corruption lost him the backing of reformers , and his legal arguments in favor of Democratic candidate Samuel J. Tilden in the disputed presidential election of 1876 outraged many Republicans . 

A gifted orator , he was dubbed " the Webster of the West . "
