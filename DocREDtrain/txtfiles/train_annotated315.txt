The Castro Theatre is a popular San Francisco movie palace which became San Francisco Historic Landmark # 100 in September 1976 . 

Located at 429 Castro Street , in the Castro district , it was built in 1922 with a Spanish Colonial Baroque façade that pays homage — in its great arched central window surmounted by a scrolling pediment framing a niche — to the recently rebuilt basilica of Mission Dolores nearby . 

Its designer , Timothy L. Pflueger , also designed Oakland 's Paramount Theater and other movie theaters in California in that period . 

The theater has over 1,400 seats ( approx 800 downstairs and 600 in the balcony ) . 

The theater 's ceiling is the last known leatherette ceiling in the United States and possibly the world . 

Another leatherette ceiling was demolished just a few years ago . 

To make the ceiling look as though it is leather requires a special technique regarded as lost today .
