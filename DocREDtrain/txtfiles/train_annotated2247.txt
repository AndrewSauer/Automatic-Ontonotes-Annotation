The Council for Mutual Economic Assistance ( , ; English abbreviation , , or ) was an economic organization from 1949 to 1991 under the leadership of the Soviet Union that comprised the countries of the Eastern Bloc along with a number of communist states elsewhere in the world . 

The descriptive term was often applied to all multilateral activities involving members of the organization , rather than being restricted to the direct functions of Comecon and its organs . 

This usage was sometimes extended as well to bilateral relations among members because in the system of socialist international economic relations , multilateral accords typically of a general nature tended to be implemented through a set of more detailed , bilateral agreements . 

Moscow was concerned about the Marshall Plan . 

Comecon was meant to prevent countries in the Soviet sphere of influence from moving towards that of the Americans and South - East Asia . 

Comecon was the Eastern Bloc 's reply to the formation in Western Europe of the Marshall Plan .
