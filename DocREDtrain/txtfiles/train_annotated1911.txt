The Battle of Groningen took place during the penultimate month of Second World War in Europe , from April 13 to 16 , 1945 , in the city of Groningen between a mixture of German soldiers , Dutch and Belgian SS troops numbering 7,000 against the entire 2nd Canadian Infantry Division , though the whole division was never in combat at any given time . 

There were also substantial amounts of Luftwaffe units manning flak guns in the area . 

Groningen was also the site of the headquarters for the Sicherheitsdienst in the North of the Netherlands . 

The German command structure was poor and the defenders had never exercised together . 

The Canadian division , consisting of nine infantry battalions , a machine gun battalion , and a reconnaissance battalion , was battle experienced with a proportion of partially trained reinforcements . 

Armour from the 10th Armoured Regiment ( The Fort Garry Horse ) and the 9th Armoured Regiment ( The British Columbia Dragoons ) was used in support .
