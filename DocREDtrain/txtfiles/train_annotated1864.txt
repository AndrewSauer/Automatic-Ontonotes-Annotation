The Bank of Credit and Commerce International ( BCCI ) was an international bank founded in 1972 by Agha Hasan Abedi , a Pakistani financier . 

The Bank was registered in Luxembourg with head offices in Karachi and London . 

A decade after opening , BCCI had over 400 branches in 78 countries , and assets in excess of US$ 20 billion , making it the 7th largest private bank in the world . 

BCCI came under the scrutiny of numerous financial regulators and intelligence agencies in the 1980s due to concerns that it was poorly regulated . 

Subsequent investigations revealed that it was involved in massive money laundering and other financial crimes , and illegally gained the controlling interest in a major American bank . 

BCCI became the focus of a massive regulatory battle in 1991 , and , on 5 July of that year , customs and bank regulators in seven countries raided and locked down records of its branch offices . 

Investigators in the United States and the UK revealed that BCCI had been " set up deliberately to avoid centralized regulatory review , and operated extensively in bank secrecy jurisdictions . 

Its affairs were extraordinarily complex . 

Its officers were sophisticated international bankers whose apparent objective was to keep their affairs secret , to commit fraud on a massive scale , and to avoid detection " . 

The liquidators , Deloitte & Touche , filed a lawsuit against the bank 's auditors , Price Waterhouse and Ernst & Young , which was settled for $ 175 million in 1998 . 

By 2013 , Deloitte & Touche claimed to have recovered about 75 % of the creditors ' lost money .
