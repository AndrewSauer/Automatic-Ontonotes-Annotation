Harbin – Qiqihar intercity railway , also known as Ha Qi passenger - dedicated line ( PDL ) , is the China ’s most northerly high - speed railway . 

It opened for revenue service on 17 August 2015 , connecting the two principal cities in Heilongjiang province , Harbin and Qiqihar . 

Operating at up to 250 km / h , the high - speed trains have cut the fastest journey time between the cities from 3 h to 85 min . 

Under construction since 2009 , the 286 km line has intermediate stations at Harbin Bei , Zhaodong , Anda , Daqing Dong , Daqing Xi and Taikang . 

It is expected to carry around 8 million passengers a year . 

The route is operated with a fleet of 28 CRH5A trainsets which have been modified to cope with the region ’s severe winter conditions , where temperatures can fall as low as -40 ° C . 

Average temperatures for January are reported to be -19·2 ° C in Qiqihar and -18·3 ° C in Harbin .
