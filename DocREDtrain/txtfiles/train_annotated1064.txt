Lee Ming - che ( 李明哲 ; born 1975 ) is a Taiwanese pro - democracy activist , detained by Chinese authorities in late March 2017 . 

After Lee entered the domain of China from Macao , he lost the ability to directly contact his family . 

There have been calls for his immediate release by human rights activists around the world . 

These include Hong Kong activist Joshua Wong , who joined Taiwan 's New Power Party Executive Chairman Huang Kuo - chang , and former Sunflower Movement leaders to condemn Lee ’s continued detention . 

Lee is a former worker for the Democratic Progressive Party and NGO employee , and the incident has led to friction between security institutions in Taiwan and China . 

A representative of the Chinese government has stated that Lee is under investigation on suspicion of harming national security . 

Ma Xiaoguang , a spokesman for Beijing 's Taiwan Affairs Office ( TAO ) , has said in a press conference that Lee is " currently in good physical condition " . 

Lee ’s wife , Lee Ching - yu , called on Beijing to immediately release him , and to clarify the charges brought against him and ensure his rights . 

Lee has previously used social media to promote the success of Taiwan 's democracy to ' at least 100 people ' in communist China . 

On this occasion , he had gone to China to arrange for his mother - in - law 's medical treatment . 

In an effort to find her husband , Lee Ching - yu booked a flight from Taiwan to China on 10 April , however she has been banned from entering China by its Ministry of Public Security . 

On 13 April , an editorial in Taiwan News asserted that this is the type of situation that should be covered by the “ Cross - Strait Joint Crime - Fighting and Judicial Mutual Assistance Agreement ” . 

On September 2017 , Lee Ming - che pleaded guilty to " subverting state power " in a court in Hunan . 

His wife and supporters say his confession was forced .
