The Arctic is a vast polar region comprising the northern most parts of Canada , Norway , Greenland ( Denmark ) , Sweden , Finland , the United States ( Alaska ) , Iceland and Russia . 

In recent years , the Arctic has been at the forefront of political and social issues . 

Several matters have risen surrounding the issues of poverty and global warming and their effects on indigenous people in this region . 

Indigenous people in the Arctic statistically fall below their nation 's poverty line . 

Indigenous populations that were once largely self - sufficient and relatively food secure in the Arctic 's harsh environment are today struggling to sustain themselves as a result of poverty and also the impacts of climate change . 

Currently , they are facing an overwhelming number of issues in relation to poverty including cultural loss , high rates of chronic illness and chronic disease , mental health disorders , lack of basic health needs and housing shortages .
