The Pink Line ( ) is a new subway line proposal for the Montreal Metro in Canada . 

First proposed by municipal councillor Sylvain Ouellet in September 2011 , the Pink Line in its current form was a " central campaign promise " of the mayoral campaign of Valérie Plante , leader of the political party Projet Montréal and now mayor of Montreal . 

The project is proposed to be finished by 2025 , at a cost of an estimated C$ 5.9 billion . 

The proposed route of the line will traverse many Montreal neighbourhoods . 

It will start in Montreal North , and travel southeast through the city , with connections to the blue line extension , Mont - Royal metro station , and Place - des - Arts station . 

Given this routing , the section from Montreal North to Pie - IX is generally seen as the successor to the cancelled White Line originally proposed in the 1980s . 

A second phase of the project will travel southwest from Downtown Montreal , through the Notre - Dame - de - Grâce neighbourhood , Montreal West , and will end at Lachine .
