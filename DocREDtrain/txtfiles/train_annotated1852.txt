Kostal Cone , also called Kostal Volcano and Fire Mountain , is a young cinder cone in Wells Gray Provincial Park in east - central British Columbia , Canada . 

It rises from the northeast shore of Kostal Lake in the Cariboo Mountains . 

With an elevation of , Kostal Cone is one of the lowest volcanoes in the Wells Gray - Clearwater volcanic field . 

There has been activity at this site as recently as 7,600 years ago , though more likely less than 1,000 years ago . 

Kostal Cone is too young for the commonly used potassium - argon dating technique ( usable on specimens over 100,000 years old ) , and no charred organic material for radiocarbon dating has been found . 

However , the uneroded structure of the cone with the existence of trees on its flanks and summit have it an area for dendrochronology studies , which reveals the growth of tree - ring patterns . 

Tree - growth data has revealed an age of 400 years for Kostal Cone , making it the youngest volcano in the Wells Gray - Clearwater volcanic field and one of the youngest volcanoes in Canada . 

Kostal Cone is made of fragmented and solidified lava called cinder and its summit contains a bowl - shaped crater . 

Kostal 's cinders were ejected by lava fountain eruptions and accumulated around the volcano 's vent in the shape of a cone when they fell back around its surroundings . 

Lava flows from Kostal 's 400 BP eruption are basaltic in composition and forms a lava bed . 

It is an example of volcanic activity that has occurred in the Wells Gray - Clearwater volcanic field since the last glacial period ; others include the Dragon 's Tongue lava flow from Dragon Cone just north of Kostal Cone and the Flourmill Volcanoes north of Mahood Lake .
