Manfred Gnjidic is a lawyer in Germany . 

In 2004 he was employed by Khalid El - Masri , a German citizen who was subjected to extraordinary rendition by the CIA in the years past . 

Gnjidic helped El - Masri launch a lawsuit against George Tenet and other Americans he alleges were involved in his rendition . 

On December 8 , 2005 , following a meeting with United States Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice , German Chancellor Angela Merkel announced that Dr Rice had privately acknowledged that El - Masri had been captured and transported in error . 

Rice then offered her account , that she had merely acknowledged that the United States had made some errors , without acknowledging that El - Masri 's rendition was an instance of those errors . 

Gnjidic has announced his intention to subpoena Merkel to testify in El - Masri 's lawsuit . 

He also represents Aleem Nasir , a German citizen interrogated by Pakistani , American and British intelligence agents during a two - month - long extrajudicial detention in Pakistan . 

Gnjidic is investigating whether information gained under coercion during these interrogations may have been used to initiate a German investigation of Nasir .
