The romanization of Serbian or latinization of Serbian is the representation of the Serbian language using Latin letters . 

Serbian is written in two alphabets , the Serbian Cyrillic alphabet , a variation of Cyrillic and the Serbian Latin alphabet , a variation of the Latin alphabet . 

The Serbian language is an example of Digraphia . 

However , Gaj 's Latin alphabet is also very widely used in Serbia as the second alphabet . 

The two are almost directly and completely interchangeable . 

Romanization can be done with no errors , but in some cases knowledge of Serbian is required to do proper transliteration from Latin back to Cyrillic . 

Standard Serbian uses both alphabets currently . 

A survey from 2014 showed that 47 % of the Serbian population favors the Latin alphabet whereas 36 % favors the Cyrillic one . 

Apart from Serbian , Gaj 's Latin alphabet is also used in Bosnian and Croatian standards of Serbo - Croatian . 

Another standard of Serbo - Croatian , Montenegrin , uses a slightly modified version of it .
