Vache II ( in Armenian Վաչե Բ. or Վաչէ Բ. ) 

was the king of Caucasian Albania from 444 to 463 .

In the middle of the 5th century by the order of the Persian king Peroz I , Vache built in Utik the city initially called Perozabad , and later Partaw and Barda , and made it the capital of Albania .

As a reaction he started his rebellion against Sassanids . 

He allied himself to Maskuts and expelled his sister and mother because of their faith in Zoroaster .
