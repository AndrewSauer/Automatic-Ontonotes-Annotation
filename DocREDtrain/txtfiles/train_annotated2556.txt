Cyprus has sent athletes to every Olympic Games held since 1980 . 

Cyprus earned its first Olympic medal in the 2012 Summer Olympics when Pavlos Kontides earned a silver medal in the men 's laser sailing event . 

They had a near miss at the 2008 Olympics when Antonis Nikolaidis lost the bronze medal shoot - off in men 's skeet . 

The first modern Olympian from Cyprus was actually Anastasios Andreou in 1896 , who competed under the Greek flag . 

At this time , Cyprus was a British colony . 

Because the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus is not internationally recognized by any major authority ( including the IOC ) , it has no Olympic committee . 

Therefore , all Cypriot Olympians are required to compete under the name and flag of the Republic of Cyprus . 

Those who are unable or unwilling to compete under the flag of the Republic either compete for Turkey , or for another country , or not at all .
