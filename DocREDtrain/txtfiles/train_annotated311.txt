The Japan Evangelistic Band ( JEB ) , or ' Kyodan Nihon Dendo Tai ' ( 日本伝道隊 ) in Japanese , is an evangelical Christian group founded in England in 1903 with the original aim to " initiate and sustain evangelistic work among Japanese wherever they are found " . 

Within thirty years the organisation grew to 180 workers from many countries , but most of them from Japan . 

The JEB 's primary field was the Kansai region of South West Japan and the island of Shikoku but missionaries worked among Japanese living on the West Coast of Canada and the USA , and in the UK . 

In 1999 the organisation in the UK adopted the name Japan Christian Link for their operations in the UK , while work in Japan continue under the name of JEB .
