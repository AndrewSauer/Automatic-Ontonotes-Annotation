" Lily of the Valley " is a song by British rock band Queen . 

Lead singer Freddie Mercury plays the piano and provides all the vocals on the track . 

It was originally featured on Queen 's third album , Sheer Heart Attack , released in 1974 , and is one of the album 's few ballads . 

In 1975 , " Lily of the Valley " was released as the B - side of different singles in the U.K. and the United States . 

The U.K. single was " Now I 'm Here " , and the U.S. single was a reissue of " Keep Yourself Alive " . 

The lyrics refer back to a song from a previous album , " Seven Seas of Rhye " from Queen II , with the line " messenger from Seven Seas has flown , to tell the King of Rhye he 's lost his throne . " 

In a 1999 interview , Brian May told the British music magazine Mojo , " Freddie 's stuff was so heavily cloaked , lyrically ... 

But you could find out , just from little insights , that a lot of his private thoughts were in there , although a lot of the more meaningful stuff was not very accessible . 

Lily of the Valley was utterly heartfelt . 

It 's about looking at his girlfriend and realising that his body needed to be somewhere else . 

It 's a great piece of art , but it 's the last song that would ever be a hit . " 

Actor Rami Malek ( who is portraying Freddie Mercury in the upcoming Queen biopic Bohemian Rhapsody ) revealed on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert that " Lily of the Valley " is his favorite Queen song .
