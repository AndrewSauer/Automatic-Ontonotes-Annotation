Oxhide ingots are metal slabs , usually of copper but sometimes of tin , produced and widely distributed during the Mediterranean Late Bronze Age ( LBA ) . 

Their shape resembles the hide of an ox with a protruding handle in each of the ingot ’s four corners . 

Early thought was that each ingot was equivalent to the value of one ox . 

However , the similarity in shape is simply a coincidence . 

The ingots’ producers probably designed these protrusions to make the ingots easily transportable overland on the backs of pack animals . 

Complete or partial oxhide ingots have been discovered in Sardinia , Crete , Peloponnese , Cyprus , Cannatello in Sicily , Boğazköy in Turkey ( ancient Hattusa , the Hittite capital ) , Qantir in Egypt ( ancient Pi - Ramesses ) , and Sozopol in Bulgaria . 

Archaeologists have recovered many oxhide ingots from two shipwrecks off the coast of Turkey ( one off Uluburun and one in Cape Gelidonya ) .
