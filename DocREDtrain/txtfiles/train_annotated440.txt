" High " was the Norwegian entry in the Eurovision Song Contest 2004 , performed in English by Knut Anders Sørum . 

The song is a dramatic ballad , with Sørum expressing his desire to bring an unnamed person " high " . 

The lyrics suggest that this person has been beset by problems , and that Sørum believes he can go some way to curing them . 

As Norway had finished the Eurovision Song Contest 2003 in the top 10 , the song was pre - qualified for the final . 

Here , it was performed third , following Austria 's Tie Break with " Du bist " and preceding France 's Jonatan Cerrada with " À chaque pas " . 

At the close of voting , it had received 3 points ( all from Sweden ) , placing 24th ( last ) in a field of 24 , thus requiring Norway to qualify through the semi - final at the next Contest . 

The low score , and long wait before Norway scored any points at all , led Australian commentator Des Mangan to jokingly offer money for anyone prepared to vote for the country . 

Initially , this was " a thousand bucks " , later climbing to " ten thousand bucks and my house " . 

Mangan explained during this commentary that he did not want Norway to further extend its unwanted record of failing to record a point on the most occasions . 

The song was succeeded as Norwegian representative at the 2005 contest by Wig Wam with " In My Dreams " .
