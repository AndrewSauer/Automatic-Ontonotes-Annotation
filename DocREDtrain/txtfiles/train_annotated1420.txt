Pierre Richardot ( c.1575 â€“ 1628 ) was the 61st abbot of St Willibrord 's Abbey , Echternach . 

He was the son of Jean Richardot , president of the Brussels Privy Council , and Anne Courcol de Baillencourt . 

Born in Arras , he studied Theology at the University of Leuven and entered the Abbey of St. Vaast in his native city . 

In 1607 Richardot was named abbot of Echternach . 

His abbacy was overshadowed by the need to economise to pay off the debts run up to ransom his predecessor , Johannes Bertelius , who had been kidnapped by Dutch freebooters . 

He died on 24 February 1628 and was buried near the high altar in the abbey church . 

During Richardot 's tenure as abbot he made a manuscript written by his medieval predecessor Thiofrid of Echternach available for publication , as Flores epitaphii sanctorum ( Luxembourg , 1619 ) .
