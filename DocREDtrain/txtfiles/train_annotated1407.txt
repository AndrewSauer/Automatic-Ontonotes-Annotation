Ealhhelm ( floruit 940 – 955 ) was an Anglo - Saxon nobleman and ealdorman in Mercia of West Saxon origins . 

It was in the reign of Edmund , circa 940 , that Ealhhelm was appointed as an ealdorman . 

He shared authority in Mercia with others , including Æthelstan Rota , Æthelmund , and another Æthelstan . 

The division is presumed to have been on a geographical basis . 

Ealhhelm and his family appear to have been connected with south - western Mercia , the former kingdom of the Hwicce , which corresponded approximately with the boundaries of the diocese of Worcester . 

Ealhhelm may have held the lands formerly belonging to Evesham Abbey as these are said to have been seized by one Alchelmus in the time of King Edmund . 

A kinsman of Ealhhelm named Wulfric — probably the father of Ealhhelm 's daughter - in - law — who later received part of the Evesham lands , may be identified with the brother of Saint Dunstan . 

Ealhhelm ceases to sign charters around 951 in the reign of King Eadred . 

The date of his death is not recorded . 

Ælfhere and Ælfheah , the sons of Ealhhelm , were ealdormen and significant figures later in the 10th century . 

Ealdorman Ælfric Cild was his son - in - law .
