Jagged Little Pill Acoustic is a studio album by Alanis Morissette . 

It is a largely acoustic retrospective version of her highly successful third album , Jagged Little Pill ( 1995 ) ; the songs are stripped - down versions of the originals , though producer Glen Ballard has augmented them with studio production effects to create an alternative pop album . 

The album was released by Maverick Records in the United States on June 13 , 2005 , available only at North American Starbucks outlets until July 26 , 2005 , when it was made available in other retail stores . 

This limited availability led to a dispute between Maverick Records and HMV Canada , who retaliated by removing from sale Morissette 's other albums for the duration of Starbucks ' exclusive month - long sale . 

The album 's single in the U.S. was " Hand in My Pocket " . 

The cover artwork is a sepia - toned tribute to the cover of the original Jagged Little Pill .
