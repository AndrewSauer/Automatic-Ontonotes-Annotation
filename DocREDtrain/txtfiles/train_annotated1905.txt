Konstantin Sokolsky ( also spelled : Sokolski , , original name Konstantin Kudryavtsev ( Константин Кудрявцев ) ) ( 7 December 1904 - 12 May 1991 ) was a Latvian Russian singer . 

Sokolsky was born in Saint - Petersburg , Russia , but for most of his life lived in Riga , Latvia ( his father came from Ludzas County , which is where the family moved to after the revolutionary turmoil of 1917 began in Saint - Petersburg ) . 

There he worked as a woodcutter and loader , until in 1928 at Riga 's ' Mars ' cinema he first appeared on stage as a singer . 

Initially , he tried to imitate Alexander Vertinsky ( for example , he too sang in a Pierrot costume ) , but later found his own style . 

He got acquainted with popular composer Oscar Strok , author of tango music , and became the first to sing all his new songs . 

In the same time , he himself wrote lyrics and music for several songs . 

In the 1930 - 1940s , first with the Riga Bonzo Theatre and later individually , he went on tours of Romania , Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia , where he became very popular among different audiences , including many Russian émigrés . 

Sokolsky 's stage image was refined , but could still be interpreted as acting the ' Russian bear ' , with a sense of self - parody . 

Very tall , joyous , with self - respect — he reminded many Russian émigrés of their Mother Russia , which they had had to leave , sooner or later after the Bolshevik revolution . 

In Russia , his songs also became popular , released on L.P. 's with the Bonophon and Bellaccord labels . 

During World War II , he stayed in Latvia . 

In 1944 he was arrested by the Germans , but escaped .
