" The Harvest Of Love " is a short comedy song , co - written and originally performed by Benny Hill , released on Pye Records ( 7N.15520 ) . 

The other writer was shown as " M. Anthony " , a pseudonym for the producer , Tony Hatch . 

The song was a # 20 hit in the UK Singles Chart in 1963 , and has appeared on several compilation albums as well as being covered by the Wurzels . 

The Benny Hill version was flipped with another Hill composition , " BAMba 3688 " . 

The record also saw a U.S. release on Rust ( 5079 ) . 

The song is sung from the point of view of a farmhand who has fallen in love ( or at least , lust ) with a young lady . 

Hill 's vocals were accompanied by the Kestrels , who instead of singing , provided a vocal back - up of farmyard impressions . 

The accompaniment was directed by Hatch . 

The Kestrels at that time were Roger Greenaway , Tony Burrows , Jeff Williams , and Roger Gullane . 

The lyrics included such lines as : 

" And as the horse and I plough the field nearby , Your memory I ca n't erase , For while I walk at the rear of the horse , my dear , I seem to see your face . " 

At the end of the song it turns out that the narrator is already married . 

In September 2013 , the original pressing of the single was found in private storage and sold for Â£ 10 at auction on the ITV daytime series Storage Hoarders .
