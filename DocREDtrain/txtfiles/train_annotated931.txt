" Got to Have Faith " was co - written by vocalist Joey Tempest and guitarist John Norum , and was the first song written for Start from the Dark . 

" We wanted to make something modern , heavy and something that would be relevant now , " Tempest said , " So John sent me some riffs to my hometown in London and I just started putting things together , writing lyrics and when I felt I had something , I sent it off to the other guys . 

They were all like , ' This is great ! ' ... 

Hence the heavier riffs , the D - tuning and everything because that 's the way John likes to do it . " 

The song 's music video features the band performing in a garage interspersed with clips taken from the Ghost Rider motorcycle stunt films . 

In an interlude , the video shows brief , distorted clips of the band taken from the 1980s . 

Ghost Rider , touching speeds over , zooms past Upplands VÃ¤sby , the Swedish suburb where the band was formed , at the end of the video .
