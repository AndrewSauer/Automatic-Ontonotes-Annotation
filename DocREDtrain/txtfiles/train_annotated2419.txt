Saint Louis is a 1592 - 1595 painting by El Greco , painted during his time in Toledo . 

It is now in the Louvre in Paris . 

It shows Louis IX of France wearing 16th century armour and a crown and holding his family symbol of a fleur de lys and the traditional sceptre of the kings of France . 

Gregorio Marañon and Manuel Bartolomé Cossío argue the model was a patient at the Hospital del Nuncio or an old print . 

Louis was the grandson of Alfonso VIII of Castile , meaning that in the late 16th century he was revered in both France and Spain , particularly since no Spanish king was canonised until Ferdinand III of Castile received the honour in 1671 . 

The work was commissioned by Luis de Castilla , the painter 's friend and future executor - the saint was also Luis ' name saint . 

For a period the work was in the collection of the château de Chenonceau , before being acquired by its present owner in 1903 . 

A recent restoration has revealed a cityscape in the background , showing Toledo .
