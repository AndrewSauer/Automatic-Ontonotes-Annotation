The Wild Wadi Water Park is an outdoor water park in Dubai , United Arab Emirates . 

Situated in the area of Jumeirah , next to the Burj Al Arab and the Jumeirah Beach Hotel , the water park is operated by Jumeirah International , a Dubai - based hotelier . 

Wild Wadi has a heated / cooled wave pool , multiple water slides and two artificial surfing machines . 

In addition , the park had the largest water slide outside of North America , but it has since been removed to make space for two other rides . 

Another feature of the park is an waterfall that goes off every ten minutes . 

The water park also has two gift shops , three restaurants and two snack stands . 

It was featured in The Amazing Race 5 and The Amazing Race Asia 1 , in which teams had to slide down a drop . 

It was later featured in The Amazing Race Australia 2 , but instead , the teams had to ride the Surf Machine and use boogie boards to surf their way to the end where they got their next clue .
