Asahel Grant ( August 17 , 1807 â€“ April 24 , 1844 ) was one of the first American missionaries to Iran . 

Asahel Grant was born at Marshall , New York , studied medicine at Pittsfield , Massachusetts , and practiced in Utica , New York . 

In 1835 he went as a missionary with the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions to Iran . 

He settled at Urmia and worked among the Nestorians there and elsewhere in western Asia . 

He died in Mosul in the Ottoman Empire . 

He was a daring adventurer throughout the Middle East , but had little success in converting the fierce Nestorians , whom he considered among the " ten lost tribes " of Israel . 

He wrote The Nestorians and an appeal for Christian doctors to engage in missionary work . 

Like David Livingstone before him ( although not as famous ) , Grant thrilled western audiences with his adventures , inspiring a number of biographies , including those cited on this page . 

His success as a physician not only saved his life on several occasions , but opened the way for missionary successors .
