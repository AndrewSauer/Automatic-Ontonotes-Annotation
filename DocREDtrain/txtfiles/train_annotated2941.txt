The Anahita Temple ( ) is the name of one of two archaeological sites in Iran popularly thought to have been attributed to the ancient deity Anahita . 

The larger and more widely known of the two is located at KangƒÅvar in Kermanshah Province . 

The other is located at Bishapur . 

The remains at Kangavar reveal an edifice that is Hellenistic in character , and yet display Persian architectural designs . 

The plinth 's enormous dimensions for example , which measure just over 200 m on a side , and its megalithic foundations , which echo Achaemenid stone platforms , " constitute Persian elements " . 

This is thought to be corroborated by the " two lateral stairways that ascend the massive stone platform recalling Achaemenid traditions " , particularly that of the Apadana Palace at Persepolis . 

Another Iranian construction with Hellenistic characteristics is the Khurra mausoleum in Markazi Province .
