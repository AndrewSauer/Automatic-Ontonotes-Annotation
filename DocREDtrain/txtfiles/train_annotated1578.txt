Eickendorf is a former municipality in the district of Salzlandkreis , in Saxony - Anhalt , Germany . 

Since January 2008 , it is part of the municipality Bördeland . 

The village is located in the Magdeburg Börde region , known for its fertile Loess ( Chernozem ) soils . 

As a yardstick for soil quality , a " Reich Standard Farm " was set up in Eickendorf according to the 1934 Soil Assessment Act , whereby a soil value of 100 was established . 

It then became the basis of comparison for the tax rating of farms in Germany . 

The settlement of Hekenthorp in the Eastphalian lands of Saxony was first mentioned in an 1176 deed . 

Ruled by several comital dynasties , after the Protestant Reformation and the Thirty Years ' War the estates became part of the secularised Duchy of Magdeburg , held by the Hohenzollern rulers of Brandenburg - Prussia . 

Eickendorf was the ancestral seat of the Eichendorff noble family , whose most prominent member is the poet Joseph Freiherr von Eichendorff ( 1788 – 1857 ) .
