The Fort Pitt Tunnel carries traffic on Interstate 376 ( I-376 ) , U.S. Route 22 ( US 22 ) , US 30 , and US 19 Truck between Downtown Pittsburgh and the West End neighborhood in the U.S. state of Pennsylvania . 

Traveling beneath Mount Washington , the structure is divided into a two lane inbound tunnel and two lane outbound tunnel . 

The inbound tunnel flows onto the top deck of the double - deck Fort Pitt Bridge , opposite traffic from the lower deck using the outbound tunnel . 

To accommodate the bridge , the northeast portals of the parallel tunnels open at two levels . 

" FORT PITT TUNNEL " is mounted in brushed steel letters on a grey granite facade above the southwest portals , with larger scaled capital letters used on the facade above the northeast portals . 

Before entering the southwest end of the inbound tunnel , travelers see a commonplace view of Southwestern Pennsylvania 's hills , but at the northeast end , travelers emerge to a panorama of Pittsburgh 's Golden Triangle and surrounding skyline , the view cited by The New York Times as " the best way to enter an American city " . 

The vantage was the inspiration for the news opening on Pittsburgh 's KDKA - TV for several years in the 1980s and 1990s , and is referenced in Stephen Chbosky 's novel The Perks of Being a Wallflower . 

The Fort Pitt Tunnel opened in 1960 , a year after the adjoining Fort Pitt Bridge . 

It is the third longest automobile tunnel in the City of Pittsburgh , following the Liberty Tunnels and the Squirrel Hill Tunnel . 

And it is one of four major tunnels passing beneath Mount Washington , including the Liberty Tunnels and the Wabash Tunnel for automobiles , and the Mount Washington Transit Tunnel for public transportation .
