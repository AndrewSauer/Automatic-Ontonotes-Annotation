Imre Makovecz ( November 20 , 1935 â€“ September 27 , 2011 ) was a Hungarian architect active in Europe from the late 1950s onward . 

Makovecz was born and died in Budapest . 

He attended the Technical University of Budapest . 

He was founder and " eternal and executive president " of the Hungarian Academy of Arts . 

Makovecz was one of the most prominent proponents of organic architecture . 

As such , his buildings attempt to work with the natural surroundings rather than triumph over them . 

Frank Lloyd Wright and Rudolf Steiner are both strong influences , as is traditional Hungarian art . 

His work began as a critique of communist ideology and the brutal uniformity of system building , but after the fall of the Communist regime in 1989 , it became a comment on the nature of globalisation and corporate culture . 

In its attempts to refer to and build on Hungarian national archetypes Makovecz was continuing the work and ideas of the architects of Hungarian Art Nouveau and National Romanticism . 

The first English language monograph on his work , Imre Makovecz : The Wings of the Soul , by Edwin Heathcote , was published in 1997 . 

Makovecz was a devout Catholic .
