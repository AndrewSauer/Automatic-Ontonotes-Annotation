The Moviegoer is the debut novel by Walker Percy , first published in the United States by Vintage in 1961 . 

It won the U.S. National Book Award . 

Time magazine included the novel in its " Time 100 Best English - language Novels from 1923 to 2005 " . 

In 1998 , the Modern Library ranked The Moviegoer sixtieth on its list of the hundred best English - language novels of the twentieth century . 

It is published in the UK by Methuen . 

The novel is heavily influenced by the existentialist themes of authors like SÃ¸ren Kierkegaard , whom Percy read extensively . 

Unlike many dark didactic existentialist novels ( including Percy 's later work ) , The Moviegoer has a light poetic tone . 

It was Percy 's first , most famous and most widely praised novel , and established him as one of the major voices in Southern literature . 

The novel also draws on elements of Dante by paralleling the themes of Binx Bolling 's life to that of the narrator of the Divine Comedy .
