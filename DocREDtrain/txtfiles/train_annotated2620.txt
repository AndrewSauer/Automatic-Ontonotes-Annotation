River Out of Eden : A Darwinian View of Life is a 1995 popular science book by Richard Dawkins . 

The book is about Darwinian evolution and summarizes the topics covered in his earlier books , The Selfish Gene , The Extended Phenotype and The Blind Watchmaker . 

It is part of the Science Masters series and is Dawkins 's shortest book . 

It is illustrated by Lalla Ward , Dawkins 's wife . 

The book 's name is derived from Genesis 2:10 relating to the Garden of Eden . 

The King James Version reads " And a river went out of Eden to water the garden ; and from thence it was parted , and became into four heads . " 

River Out of Eden has five chapters . 

The first chapter lays down the framework on which the rest of the book is built , that life is like a river of genes flowing through geological time where organisms are mere temporary bodies . 

The second chapter shows how human ancestry can be traced via many gene pathways to different most recent common ancestors , with special emphasis on the African Eve . 

The third chapter describes how gradual enhancement via natural selection is the only mechanism which can create the observed complexity of nature . 

The fourth chapter describes the indifference of genes towards organisms they build and discard , as they maximise their own utility functions . 

The last chapter summarises milestones during the evolution of life on Earth and speculates on how similar processes may work in alien planetary systems .
