Le Bernardin is a French seafood restaurant in Midtown Manhattan in New York City . 

Gilbert Le Coze and his sister Maguy Le Coze started the restaurant in Paris in 1972 , where it was called Les Moines de St. Bernardin . 

They restarted the restaurant in New York in 1986 , not long after receiving a third Michelin star . 

Gilbert le Coze died of a heart attack in 1994 , and Ã‰ric Ripert succeeded him as chef de cuisine . 

Chef Ripert later opened another restaurant , Philadelphia 's 10 Arts and Westend Bistro , in Washington , D.C .. 

Signature dishes include kindai maguro ( farmed Pacific bluefin tuna ) and wagyu beef . 

In 2016 , investigative journalists from the US news program Inside Edition found that Le Bernardin , among other restaurants , was falsely marketing their beef as Kobe beef . 

After the report , the restaurant reworded their menu to read wagyu beef . 

In 2018 , a former waitress brought suit against the restaurant , alleging sexual harassment and gender discrimination .
