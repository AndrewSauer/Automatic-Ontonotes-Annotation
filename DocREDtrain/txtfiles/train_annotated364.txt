The Upper Galilee ( , HaGalil Ha'Elyon ; , Al Jaleel Al A'alaa ) is a geographical - political term in use since the end of the Second Temple period , originally referring to a mountainous area straddling present - day northern Israel and southern Lebanon , its boundaries being the Litani River in the north , the Mediterranean Sea in the west , the Lower Galilee in the south , from which it is separated by the Beit HaKerem Valley , and the upper Jordan River and the Hula Valley in the east . 

According to 1st - century historian , Josephus , the bounds of Upper Galilee stretched from Bersabe in the Beit HaKerem Valley to Baca ( Peki'in ) in the north . 

The said region contains approximately 180 square miles . 

In present - day Israeli terminology , the toponym is mainly used in reference to the northern part of the Galilee situated under Israeli sovereignty , i.e. 

without the part of Southern Lebanon up to the Litani River , while also excluding the corresponding stretches of the Coastal Plain to the west and Jordan Rift Valley to the east , which are considered separate geographical entities .
