Sachen Kunga Nyingpo ( ) ( 1092 – 1158 ) was a Tibetan spiritual leader and the first of the Five Venerable Supreme Sakya Masters of Tibet . 

Sachen Kunga Nyinpo was the 3rd Sakya Trizin and son of Khon Konchok Gyalpo ( 1034 – 1102 ) who was the first Sakya Trizin and founder of the first Sakya Monastery in Tibet in 1073 . 

Sachen Kunga Nyingpo , the son of Khon Konchok Gyalpo and an emanation of Manjushri , was born in 1092 into the prominent Khon clan of Sakya . 

From early childhood , Sachen showed great signs of wisdom . 

At the age of twelve , Sachen , under the guidance of his guru , Bari Lotsava , performed one - point meditation on Manjushri . 

After meditating on this for a continuous period of six months , the bodhisattva appeared in front of him and gave him the teachings on the parting of four attachments as follows : 

If you cling to this life , then you are not a dharma practitioner ; 

If you cling to the wheel of existence , then you do not possess renunciation ( nekkhamma ) ; 

If you look only to your own interests , then you do not possess bodhichitta ; 

If clinging ensues , then you do not possess the view . 

Sachen realised in an instant that this teaching contained the essence of the Path of Perfection . 

He was a strict vegetarian and received teachings and empowerments on sutras and tantras from many great teachers , including his father and Virupa . 

Sachen was a man of immense virtue and bodhicitta . 

He had immeasurable faith in his practice and was a great teacher of Dharma . 

Sachen passed all the doctrines to his two sons , Sonam Tsemo and Drakpa Gyaltsen . 

He died at the age of 67 in 1158 .
