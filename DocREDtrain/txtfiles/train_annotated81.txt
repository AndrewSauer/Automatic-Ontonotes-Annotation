" Ik wil alles met je delen " ( " I want to share everything with you " ) was the Dutch entry in the Eurovision Song Contest 1990 , performed in Dutch by Maywood . 

The English language version was entitled " No more winds to guide me " . 

The song is a ballad , with the singer telling her lover that she wants to share everything with him - including the hard times in life . 

She sings that life is a " merry - go - round " , and that if she is there when things are bad , she will also be there when they are good . 

The song was performed fifth on the night , following Turkey 's Kayahan with Gözlerinin Hapsindeyim and preceding Luxembourg 's Céline Carzo with " Quand je te rêve " . 

At the close of voting , it had received 25 points , placing 15th in a field of 22 . 

The Netherlands opted out of the 1991 contest , as it coincided with the country 's Remembrance of the Dead commemorations . 

Thus , the song was succeeded as Dutch representative at the 1992 contest by Humphrey Campbell with " Wijs me de weg " .
