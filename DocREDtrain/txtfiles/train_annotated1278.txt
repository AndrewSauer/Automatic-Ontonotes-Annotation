Machine + Soul is the eleventh solo studio album by English musician Gary Numan , released in 1992 . 

It was a low point , released primarily to help pay off debt , and was the last of his efforts to make his music more radio - friendly . 

His subsequent work went in the much darker and more industrial direction that would revive his career . 

Numan 's two previous studio albums , 1988 's Metal Rhythm and 1991 's Outland , had been released through IRS Records . 

However , Numan 's relationship with that label had become strained , leading to his quitting IRS and reactivating his own label , Numa Records , on which he had released his work from 1984 until 1986 . 

He continued to release albums on that label , before closing it down permanently after Sacrifice .
