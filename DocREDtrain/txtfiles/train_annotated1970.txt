Crossing the Water is a 1971 posthumous collection of poetry by Sylvia Plath that was prepared for publication by Ted Hughes . 

These are transitional poems that were written along with the poems that appear in her poetic opus , Ariel . 

The collection was published in the United Kingdom by Faber & Faber ( 1975 ) and in the United States by Harper & Row ( 1976 ) . 

The poems here tend to dwell on one 's state of being in an environment . 

" Wuthering Heights , " for example , details a walk that Plath takes along the Yorkshire moors where Emily BrontÃ« once trekked , Finisterre is a stormy island where Plath and her family once visited and " Among the Narcissi " describes Plath 's similarities at being among asexual vegetation .
