Programming Language Design and Implementation ( PLDI ) is one of the ACM SIGPLAN 's most important conferences . 

The precursor of PLDI was the Symposium on Compiler Optimization , held July 27â€“28 , 1970 at the University of Illinois at Urbana - Champaign and chaired by Robert S. Northcote . 

That conference included papers by Frances E. Allen , John Cocke , Alfred V. Aho , Ravi Sethi , and Jeffrey D. Ullman . 

The first conference in the current PLDI series took place in 1979 under the name SIGPLAN Symposium on Compiler Construction in Denver , Colorado . 

The next Compiler Construction conference took place in 1982 in Boston , Massachusetts . 

The Compiler Construction conferences then alternated with SIGPLAN Conferences on Language Issues until 1988 , when the conference was renamed to PLDI . 

From 1982 until 2001 , the conference acronym was SIGPLAN ' xx . 

Starting in 2002 , the initialism became PLDI ' xx , and in 2006 PLDI xxxx .
