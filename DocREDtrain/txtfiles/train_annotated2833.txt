Jell - O salad ( also called gelatin salad , jelly salad , congealed salad , or molded salad ) is a salad made with flavored gelatin , fruit , and sometimes grated carrots or more rarely , other vegetables . 

Other ingredients may include cottage cheese , cream cheese , marshmallows , nuts , or pretzels . 

These salads were popular in the 1960s . 

Because of its many elements , the result has speckled bits of color against a colored gelatin background . 

For example , one might have lime green gelatin with brown nuts or pretzels , bits of white from cottage cheese , and red and orange from the fruit cocktail . 

Therefore , it has a " salad " appearance . 

The " salad " theme continues in variants containing mayonnaise or salad dressing . 

When one uses plain gelatin instead of sweetened gelatin , then the use of vegetables becomes more common , such as in tomato aspic . 

The name comes from the brand name Jell - O , a common gelatin product . 

Jell - O salads are a common feature of US communal meals such as potlucks , most probably because they are inexpensive and easy to prepare . 

The origins of Jell - O salad can be traced back to a dish called Perfection Salad , by Mrs. John E. Cook of New Castle , Pennsylvania , which won third prize in a Better Homes & Gardens recipe contest . 

In Utah , where Jell - O is the official state snack , Jell - O salad is available in local restaurants such as Chuck - A - Rama . 

A traditional Newfoundland cold plate also commonly includes variations of a Jell - O salad .
