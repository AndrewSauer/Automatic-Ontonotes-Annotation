The Calhoun Depot was a railway station of the Western & Atlantic Railroad that was built by the State of Georgia during 1852 - 53 in Calhoun , Georgia . 

Unusual for railroads , the Western & Atlantic Railroad was owned and operated by a U.S. state . 

Calhoun is on its route built from Atlanta , Georgia to Chattanooga , Tennessee . 

Like other brick or stone depots on the line , the Calhoun Depot was involved in but survived the American Civil War . 

It was part of the Great Locomotive Chase . 

It was listed on the NRHP in 1982 . 

It was deemed significant architecturally " because it represents an antebellum depot designed and built to serve its essential functions . 

Its simple lines and fundamental , utilitarian styling exemplifies the early , unpretentious frontier times of North Georgia in which it was created . " 

The depot was also deemed significant in transportation history " because it symbolizes the effect the arrival of the railroad had on the area . " 

The town of Calhoun , which grew from a settlement known as Oothcalooga , is in area that was taken from the Cherokee Nation in the 1830s . 

Its location was in Cass County and then Bartow County . 

At some point it became a railroad stop and finally in 1850 it became the first county seat of new Gordon County . 

Oothcalooga was soon renamed to Calhoun . 

According to its NRHP nomination , " The selection of the site for a railroad stop was a prime factor in its later becoming the county seat . 

The railroad served as a major travel artery , as well as a supply line during the Civil War . 

It was also part of one of the war 's most famous events , during the Great Locomotive Chase . " 

After 1890 , the State - owned W & A Line was leased to the L & N Railroad . 

As of 1982 , freight service continued on the line , although passenger service had been discontinued in the 1960s .
