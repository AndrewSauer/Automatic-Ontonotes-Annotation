The GOST block cipher ( Magma ) , defined in the standard GOST 28147 - 89 ( RFC 5830 ) , is a Soviet and Russian government standard symmetric key block cipher with a block size of 64 bits . 

The original standard , published in 1989 , did not give the cipher any name , but the most recent revision of the standard , GOST R 34.12 - 2015 , specifies that it may be referred to as Magma . 

The GOST hash function is based on this cipher . 

The new standard also specifies a new 128-bit block cipher called Kuznyechik . 

Developed in the 1970s , the standard had been marked " Top Secret " and then downgraded to " Secret " in 1990 . 

Shortly after the dissolution of the USSR , it was declassified and it was released to the public in 1994 . 

GOST 28147 was a Soviet alternative to the United States standard algorithm , DES Thus , the two are very similar in structure .
