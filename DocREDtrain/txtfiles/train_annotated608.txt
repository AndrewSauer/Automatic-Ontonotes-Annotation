The Field Marshals ' Hall of the Winter Palace in Saint Petersburg was built to honor Imperial Russia 's greatest military leaders â€” Russian generals who attained the rank of Field Marshal . 

( The only higher rank was that of Generalissimo , attained by four generals and , in the Soviet period , bestowed on Joseph Stalin ) . 

This great hall and the adjacent throne room are part of the suite of rooms that were created in the western part of the Winter Palace for Tsar Nicholas I in 1833 by architect Auguste de Montferrand . 

The great fire , which destroyed the interior of the Winter Palace , began in this hall on 17 December 1837 . 

It destroyed all in its path for over thirty hours . 

Following the fire , the hall was rebuilt in its original style by the architect Vasily Stasov . 

Today , as part of the State Hermitage Museum , this room retains its recreated decoration by Stasov .
