The Second Boer War was fought from 11 October 1899 until 31 May 1902 , between the British Empire and the two independent Boer republics of the Orange Free State and the South African Republic ( Transvaal Republic ) . 

It was a lengthy war involving large numbers of troops which ended with the conversion of the Boer republics into British colonies , with a promise of limited self - government . 

These colonies later formed part of the Union of South Africa . 

During the Boer war , 22,000 troops were treated for wounds inflicted during battle . 

The surgical facilities provided by the British Army were vastly more effective than in previous campaigns . 

The Medical Department of the army mobilised 151 staff and regimental units . 

Twenty eight field ambulances , five stationary hospitals and 16 general hospitals were established to deal with casualties . 

Numerous voluntary organizations set up additional hospitals , medical units and first aid posts . 

Around one thousand Indians from Natal were shipped to South Africa to help in the recovery effort by transporting the wounded off the battlefields . 

Even Mahatma Gandhi , who was practising as a lawyer at the time in Durban , was a volunteer , helping recovery efforts in the Battles of Colenso and Spionkop . 

A second unit was established by Johannesburg and Cape Town Jews and aided both armies .
