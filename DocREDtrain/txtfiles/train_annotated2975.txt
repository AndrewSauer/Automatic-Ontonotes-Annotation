" Father 's Day " is the eighth episode of the first series of the British science fiction television programme Doctor Who , first broadcast on 14 May 2005 on BBC One . 

It was written by Paul Cornell and directed by Joe Ahearne . 

In the episode , alien time traveller the Doctor ( Christopher Eccleston ) agrees to take his companion Rose Tyler ( Billie Piper ) back to the day her father Pete ( Shaun Dingwall ) died in 1987 . 

When Rose intervenes and pulls her father out of the path of a car , time is wounded and dangerous Reapers attack , threatening to erase history . 

Pete eventually realises that to get rid of the Reapers , he must throw himself under the car that was originally meant to kill him . 

Lead writer and executive producer Russell T Davies conceived " Father 's Day " as an emotionally driven time travel story to explore Rose 's character . 

He chose Cornell to write the episode ; Cornell had written spin - off material during the years the programme was on hiatus . 

The monster element of the story was expanded based on suggestions from Cornell and BBC Head of Drama Jane Tranter , and the Reapers went through many designs . 

The episode was filmed in November 2004 at St Paul 's Church and streets in Cardiff . 

" Father 's Day " was watched by 8.06 million viewers in the United Kingdom and received generally positive reviews . 

Critics praised the focus on character and emotion .
