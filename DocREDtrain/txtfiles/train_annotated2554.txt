The Warmers were a post - hardcore band based in Washington , D.C. active from 1994 to 1997 . 

A trio featuring former Faith vocalist Alec MacKaye ( guitar and vocals ) , Juan Luis Carrera ( bass and vocals ) , and Amy Farina ( drums ) , The Warmers recorded for the Washington D.C. based record label Dischord . 

Their self - titled album The Warmers , released in February 1996 , was praised for its minimalism and Farina 's " furious " drumming . 

“ The thing that really knocked me out is the not - drumming in her drumming , where she does n’t bang where she ’s supposed to , and holds off , and then puts it in , ” said MacKaye of Farina 's style . 

“ The rhythm is just too awesome . 

Had we gotten a hot - shot guitar player , they might want to rock the guitar a little too hard , and we ’d lose the attention to the rhythm . ” 

An EP entitled Wanted : More was released posthumously in May 2004 and features six songs recorded in December 1996 . 

" Poked It With A Stick " , originally from their album The Warmers , is featured on the three - CD compilation album 20 Years of Dischord . 

Farina would go on to form The Evens with Alec 's brother and her husband Ian MacKaye .
