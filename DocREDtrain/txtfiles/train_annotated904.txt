Fanderson is the official appreciation society for the works of British film and television producers Gerry and Sylvia Anderson . 

It is a not - for - profit organisation endorsed by ITV Studios Global Entertainment , ITC Entertainment Group , The Indestructible Production Company and Anderson Entertainment . 

Based in the United Kingdom , but with an international membership , the club is run by a small committee of unpaid volunteers . 

The club was formed on 20 August 1981 at a meeting convened by ITC and Gerry Anderson . 

Previously , ITC had supported the various clubs and societies that followed Anderson 's works ; in 1981 it requested that the separate groups merge , and in exchange promised to give its full support ( except financial assistance ) to the new organisation .
