The Tunbao ( or Tunpu ) ( Simplified Chinese : 屯堡 ) are an officially unrecognized ethnic group of Guizhou and Yunnan provinces , China . 

The Tunbao are descended from ethnic Han people who were part of an army sent on an expedition to Guizhou during the Hongwu reign of the Ming Dynasty . 

Long thought to have been a non - Han ethnic minority , their Han origins were proved by Japanese anthropologist Torii Ryuzo in 1896 . 

The Tunbao have preserved much of their culture , costumes , and language from the Ming era . 

The Tianlong Tunbao town , located near Anshun is a historic site where Tunbao homes and customs have been preserved , including the traditional Dixi opera or " ground opera " performances .
