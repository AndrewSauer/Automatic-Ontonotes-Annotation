Baltimore has been described by some as " Charm City , " by others as " Bodymore , Murderland . " 

F. Scott Fitzgerald , who lived there for five years in the 1930s , wrote of it , " I belong here , where everything is civilized and gay and rotted and polite . " 

A recent listing of ten best movies set in Baltimore includes works by Baltimore natives such as Anne Tyler , John Waters , and Barry Levinson . 

Filmmakers explained their choice of Baltimore as a setting for the 2009 movie He 's Just Not That Into You because " We were trying to think of an American urban city that did n't feel like you 'd seen it a million times before , " and " We wanted something like , not exactly every - small - town U.S.A. , but every - urban - young - center U.S.A. , so we could all see ourselves in these people .
