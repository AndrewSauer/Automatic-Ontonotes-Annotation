Crkvine ( ) is a Neolithic locality and an archaeological site in the village of Stubline in the municipality of Obrenovac , which is part of the City of Belgrade , the capital of Serbia . 

The Neolithic settlement is dated to the 5th millennium BC and was part of the Vinča culture . 

The research of the site began in 1962 and the locality was declared a cultural monument in 2014 . 

The site gives an unprecedented possibility of researching the architecture and urbanism of the Vinča culture as it marks the previously unrecorded and unique settlement type of this cultural group . 

Taking in account its geographical position , a regular street - like layout of houses , close economic and , presumably , social connections with the surrounding contemporary settlements and beyond , the Crkvine settlement appears to be a " burgeoning proto - urban society " , in the region bounded by three rivers , the Sava , Kolubara and Tamnava .
