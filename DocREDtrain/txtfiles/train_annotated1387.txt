Theodore Vernon Enslin ( March 25 , 1925 â€“ November 21 , 2011 ) was an American poet associated with Cid Corman 's Origin and press . 

He is widely regarded as one of the most musical of American avant - garde poets . 

Enslin was born in Chester , Pennsylvania . 

His father was a biblical scholar and his mother a Latin scholar . 

He studied musical composition at Cambridge , Massachusetts . 

His teacher , Nadia Boulanger , was the first person to recognize his ability as a writer and encouraged him to pursue his interest in poetry . 

He has said " I like to be considered as a composer who happens to use words instead of notes . " 

His first book , The Work Proposed , was published by Origin in 1958 . 

Enslin moved to Maine in 1960 and had lived in Washington County ever since , working at odd jobs and making and selling handmade walking sticks . 

The Maine landscape forms an integral part of his poetry , as does the isolation , both geographic and in terms of distance from literary fashion and the academy his life on the physical margin of the United States allows . 

Ranger 1978 is one of the key American long poems of the second half of the 20th century . 

He died in Milbridge , Maine on November 21 , 2011 .
