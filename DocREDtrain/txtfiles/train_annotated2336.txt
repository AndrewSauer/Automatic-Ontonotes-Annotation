Siebe Gorman & Company Ltd was a British company that developed diving equipment and breathing equipment and worked on commercial diving and marine salvage projects . 

The company advertised itself as ' Submarine Engineers ' . 

It was founded by Augustus Siebe , a German - born British engineer chiefly known for his contributions to diving equipment . 

Siebe plc started in the 1970s as a continuation of Siebe Gorman when Siebe Gorman started to take over other firms , to mean the new conglomerate to distinguish it from Siebe Gorman 's original breathing apparatus and diving gear core business . 

Siebe plc was once one of the United Kingdom 's largest engineering businesses . 

It was a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index but in 1999 it merged with BTR plc to form Invensys . 

Invensys was taken over by the French multinational Schneider Electric for Â£ 3.4 billion in January 2014 .
