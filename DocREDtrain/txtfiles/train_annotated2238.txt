Miss Moneypenny , later assigned the first names of Eve or Jane , is a fictional character in the James Bond novels and films . 

She is secretary to M , who is Bond 's superior officer and head of the British Secret Intelligence Service ( MI6 ) . 

Although she has a small part in most of the films , it is always highlighted by the underscored romantic tension between her and Bond ( something that is virtually non - existent in Ian Fleming 's novels , though is somewhat more apparent in the Bond novels by John Gardner and Raymond Benson ) . 

On that note , she is not always considered to be a Bond girl , having never had anything more than a professional relationship with Bond . 

Although not given a first name by Fleming , the character was given the name Jane in the spin - off book series , The Moneypenny Diaries ; in the films , she received the first name of Eve in Skyfall ( 2012 ) , where the character spent time as a field agent before becoming secretary to M. According to the film You Only Live Twice ( 1967 ) , she holds the rank of second officer in the Women 's Royal Naval Service .
