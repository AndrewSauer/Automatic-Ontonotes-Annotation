Religion in Iceland has been predominantly Christian since its adoption as the state religion by the Althing under the influence of Olaf Tryggvason , the king of Norway , in 999/1000 CE . 

Before that , between the 9th and 10th century , the prevailing religion among the early Icelanders ( mostly Norwegian settlers fleeing Harald Fairhair 's monarchical centralisation in 872–930 ) was the northern Germanic religion , which persisted for centuries even after the official Christianisation of the state . 

Starting in the 1530s , Iceland , originally Catholic and under the Danish crown , formally switched to Lutheranism with the Icelandic Reformation , which culminated in 1550 . 

The Lutheran Church of Iceland has remained since then the country 's state church . 

Freedom of religion has been granted to the Icelanders since 1874 . 

The Church of Iceland is supported by the government , but all registered religions receive support from a church tax ( sóknargjald ) paid by taxpayers over the age of sixteen . 

Since the late 20th century , and especially the early 21st century , religious life in Iceland has become more diverse , with a decline of Christianity , the rise of unaffiliated people , and the emergence of new religions , notably Heathenry , in Iceland also called Ásatrú , which seeks to reconstruct the Germanic folk religion . 

A large part of the population remain members of the Church of Iceland , but are actually irreligious and atheists , as demonstrated by demoscopic analyses .
