The Bust of Victor Hugo is an 1883 patinated plaster sculpture by the French artist Auguste Rodin of the Romantic writer Victor Hugo . 

It is now in the Museo Soumaya in Mexico City . 

In 1883 the journalist Edmond Bazire advised Rodin to cement his reputation by producing a portrait of a notable personality . 

Rodin thus approached Hugo - he agreed to sittings but refused to sit for longer than 30 minutes . 

However , he did invite Rodin to stand in the porch of Hugo 's house on Avenue d'Eylau in Paris to make additional drawings from a distance whilst Hugo worked in his living room . 

He made these drawings from different angles between February and April 1883 , capturing a range of different angles and expressions . 

He later made frontal and three - quarter - view engravings . 

The work in Mexico is the first version of the work , cast in bronze in June 1884 and exhibited at the Paris Salon . 

Rodin continued to refine the image , producing a second version in 1884 and refining the 1883 work until 1885 , around the time of Hugo 's death . 

Rodin used a larger version of the 1883 work to produce his Monument to Victor Hugo in 1887 .
