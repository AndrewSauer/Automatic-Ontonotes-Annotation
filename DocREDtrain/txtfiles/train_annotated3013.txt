Richard Anthony Monsour ( born May 4 , 1937 ) , better known by his stage name Dick Dale , is an American rock guitarist , known as The King of the Surf Guitar . 

He pioneered and created what many call the surf music style , drawing on Middle - Eastern music scales and experimenting with reverberation . 

He worked closely with Fender to produce custom made amplifiers , including the first - ever 100-watt guitar amplifier . 

He pushed the limits of electric amplification technology , helping to develop new equipment that was capable of producing distorted , " thick , clearly defined tones " at " previously undreamed - of volumes . " 

The " breakneck speed of his single - note staccato picking technique " and showmanship with the guitar is considered a precursor to heavy metal music , influencing guitarists such as Jimi Hendrix and Eddie Van Halen .
