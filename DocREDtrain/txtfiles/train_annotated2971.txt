Ayatollah of Rock ' n ' Rolla is a 2014 single released by Soulfly . 

The song was first released on the album Savages in 2013 . 

The song 's title was inspired by a quote from the film Mad Max 2 . 

The song features Neil Fallon of Clutch , providing clean vocals in addition to roars by Max Cavalera . 

The song contains elements of southern metal in the Pantera style . 

Fallon has thoughts about himself and Cavalera singing together , " I am stoked to have been asked by Max to participate on the ' Ayatollah Of Rock ' N ' Rolla ' track ! 

Max brought Clutch out on some of our earliest and most formative tours and this brought back some very fond memories of singing with Max all those years ago . " 

Cavalera quoted about his likeness to Ghost Cult magazine , " A song like ' Ayatollah of Rock ' N ' Rolla , ' it was something totally new . 

I never did anything like that before . 

It starts with like this Country , cowboy riff , and Neil starts talking over it and it was so killer ! 

And of course that line in the chorus ' Ayatollah of Rock ' N ' Rolla ' is from Mad Max . 

It 's probably my favorite song on the album . 

I do n't want to make the same record over and over . " 

Cavalera commented to Songfacts about why he wanted Neil Fallon to join him , " I thought it was a great idea to do a song with Clutch , and mixing Soulfly and Clutch together in the same song for me sounded just so amazing and unusual and wild and exotic , which was great . 

We did it and it sounds killer . "
