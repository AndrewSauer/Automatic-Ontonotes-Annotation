The Liberal Popular Alliance ( ) , whose full name was Liberal Popular Alliance – Autonomies ( Alleanza Liberalpopolare – Autonomie , ALA ) , was a centrist and liberal political party in Italy . 

ALA members are known as Verdiniani , from the name of their leader Denis Verdini , who was formerly a long - time member and national coordinator of three successive centre - right parties led by Silvio Berlusconi ( Forza Italia , The People of Freedom and Forza Italia ) until July 2015 , when he broke with Berlusconi in order to support the government led by Matteo Renzi , leader of the centre - left Democratic Party . 

Verdini aimed at launching the " Moderates for Renzi " , that would eventually include the other centrist parties supporting the government . 

After Renzi 's resignation as Prime Minister in December 2016 the party lost relevance and after the 2018 general election it was deprived of its parliamentary representation .
