Washington teams are widely known as some of the least successful in recent American sports , as prior to 2018 , no Big Four team ( the NFL 's Washington Redskins , the NBA 's Washington Wizards , MLB 's Washington Nationals , and the NHL 's Washington Capitals ) had reached its sport 's conference championship round since the Capitals advanced in the 1998 Stanley Cup playoffs , and no team had won a league championship since the Redskins defeated the Buffalo Bills in Super Bowl XXVI in 1992 . 

However , in 2018 , those streaks were broken when the Washington Capitals defeated the Vegas Golden Knights in game 5 of the 2018 Stanley Cup Finals . 

These teams are also known for having spectacular regular seasons followed by demoralizing playoff losses . 

The area is home to two regional sports television networks , NBC Sports Washington , which is based in Bethesda , Maryland , and Mid - Atlantic Sports Network .
