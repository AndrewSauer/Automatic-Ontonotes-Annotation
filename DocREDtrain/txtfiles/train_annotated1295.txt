The Evening Post was an afternoon metropolitan daily newspaper based in Wellington , New Zealand . 

It was founded in 1865 by Dublin - born printer , newspaper manager and leader - writer Henry Blundell , who brought his large family to New Zealand in 1863 . 

With his partner from what proved to be a false - start at Havelock , David Curle , who left the partnership that July , Henry and his three sons printed with a hand - operated press and distributed Wellington 's first daily newspaper , The Evening Post , on 8 February 1865 . 

Operating from 1894 as Blundell Bros Limited his sons and their descendants continued the very successful business which dominated its circulation area . 

While The Evening Post was remarkable in not suffering the rapid circulation decline of evening newspapers elsewhere it was decided in 1972 to merge ownership with that of the never - as - successful politically conservative morning paper , The Dominion , which belonged to listed Wellington Publishing Company Limited , within a new holding company â€” Independent Newspapers Limited . 

Wellington Publishing Company Limited had been , in 1964 , the very first part of the Rupert Murdoch international empire .
