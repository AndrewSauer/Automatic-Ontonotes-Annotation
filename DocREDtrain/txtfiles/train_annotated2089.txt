Herrerasaurids are dinosaurs appearing at around 223.23 million years ago ( Late Triassic ) . 

These dinosaurs became extinct by the end of the Triassic period . 

Herrerasaurids were small - sized ( normally not more than long ) carnivorous basal saurischians . 

The best known representatives of this group are from South America ( Brazil , Argentina ) , where they were first discovered in the 1960s . 

A nearly complete skeleton of Herrerasaurus ischigulastensis was discovered in the Ischigualasto Formation in San Juan , Argentina , in 1988 . 

Less complete herrerasaurids have been found in North America , and they may have inhabited other continents as well . 

Herrerasaurid anatomy is unusual and specialized , and they are not considered to be ancestral to any later dinosaur group . 

They only superficially resemble theropods and often present a mixture of very primitive and derived traits . 

The acetabulum is only partly open , and there are only two sacral vertebrae , the lowest number among dinosaurs . 

The pubic bone has a derived structure , being rotated somewhat posteriorly and folded to create a superficially tetanuran - like terminal expansion , especially prominent in H. ischigulastensis . 

The hand is primitive in having five metacarpals and the third finger longer than the second , but resembles those of theropods in having only three long fingers , with curved claws . 

Herrerasaurids also have a hinged mandible , which is also found in theropods .
