Prayer in the Hebrew Bible is an evolving means of interacting with God , most frequently through a spontaneous , individual , unorganized form of petitioning and/or thanking . 

Standardized prayer such as is done today is non - existent , though beginning in Deuteronomy , the Bible lays the groundwork for organized prayer , including basic liturgical guidelines , and by the Bible 's later books , prayer has evolved to a more standardized form , although still radically different from the form practiced by modern Jews . 

Individual prayer is described by the Tanakh two ways . 

The first of these is when prayer is described as occurring , and a result is achieved , but no further information regarding a person 's prayer is given . 

In these instances , such as with Isaac , Moses , Samuel , and Job , the act of praying is a method of changing a situation for the better . 

The second way in which prayer is depicted is through fully fleshed out episodes of prayer , where a person 's prayer is related in full . 

Many famous biblical personalities have such a prayer , including every major character from Hannah to Hezekiah .
