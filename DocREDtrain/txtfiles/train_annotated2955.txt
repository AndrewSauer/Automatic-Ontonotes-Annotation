Barbro Stigsdotter ( 1472 - 1528 ) , was a Swedish noble . 

She is famous for her part in the Vasasagan ( Vasa Saga ) , the traditional national legend about the accession to the throne of King Gustav Vasa of Sweden . 

Barbro Stigsdotter was the daughter of Stig Hansson , a Vogt of the mine Jönshyttan in Tuna , and married the noble Are nt Persson of Ornäs . 

According to the chronicle of Peder Swart , Gustav Vasa , who was hunted by the Danes , passed her home as a guest during his flight from the Danes in 1520 . 

Her spouse was to have planned to have him taken prisoner and delivered to the Danes . 

Barbro Stigsdotter , however , warned Gustav Vasa , which made is possible for him to escape capture . 

As this eventually lead to Sweden becoming independent from the Danes with Vasa as its monarch , her act of loyalty made her a national heroine in the chronicle . 

There is another document that claims that it was not her spouse , but her father , whom she defied by thwarting his plans of delivering Vasa to the Danes . 

Except for the uncertainty on this detail , the account of her saving Gustav Vasa on this occasion is regarded to be genuine and accurate . 

In the national National Portrait Gallery ( Sweden ) of Gripsholm , which was opened in the 1822 , her portrait was featured among six of the most famous Swedish women in history along with Bridget of Sweden , Sophia Rosenhane , Hedvig Charlotta Nordenflycht , Sophia Elisabet Brenner and Vendela Skytte .
