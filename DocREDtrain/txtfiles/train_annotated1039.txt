The Second Battle of Dernancourt , known to the Germans as Unternehmen Sonnenschein ( Operation Sunshine ) , was fought on 5 April 1918 near Dernancourt in northern France during World War I. 

It involved a German Army force attacking an Australian defending force , and resulted in the German capture of much of the forward sector of the Australian front line which ran along a railway line between Albert and Dernancourt . 

The Australian 4th Division had been sent south to help stem the tide of the German Spring Offensive towards Amiens , and held a line west and north of the Ancre river . 

The main German assault force was the XXIII Reserve Corps , which concentrated its assault on the line between Albert and Dernancourt . 

Their attack at the boundary between the Australian 12th and 13th Brigades overwhelmed the Australian front line troops near Dernancourt and captured some support trenches . 

An Australian counter - attack in the afternoon wrested the initiative from the Germans and their attack petered out , leaving the Australians still in possession of most of the high ground northwest of Dernancourt , barring the way to Amiens .
