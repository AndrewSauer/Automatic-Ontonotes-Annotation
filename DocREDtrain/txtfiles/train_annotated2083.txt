William Earl Barber ( November 30 , 1919 â€“ April 19 , 2002 ) was a United States Marine Corps colonel . 

He fought on Iwo Jima during World War II and was awarded the Medal of Honor for his actions in the Battle of Chosin Reservoir during the Korean War . 

Then Captain Barber and his company of 220 men held off more than 1,400 Chinese soldiers during six days of fighting in North Korea . 

Despite the extreme cold weather conditions and a bullet wound to the leg , Barber refused evacuation and an order for his company to withdraw from their mountain pass defensive position which was surrounded . 

Barber , aware that leaving would cause 8,000 Marines of his division to be trapped in North Korea , held on to the position with his men , killing over 1,000 enemy troops ; only 82 of his men were able to walk away after eventually being relieved .
