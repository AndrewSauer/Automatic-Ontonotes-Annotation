The Tewantin National Park is a 13 square kilometer national park in Queensland , Australia . 

It consists of five individual areas west of Noosa Heads in the Wide Bay - Burnett region about 115 kilometers north of Brisbane and 125 Â  km south of Hervey Bay . 

The park is divided into disconnected sections within Lake Macdonald , Tinbeerwah , Tewantin and Noosaville . 

The national park protects coastal rainforest , bright eucalyptus forest and the last remnants of Wallum Heath between Noosa and Cooray . 

The Mount Tinbeerwah ( 265 m ) is composed of solidified lava , which was created by volcanic activity millions of years ago . 

In its surroundings you can find the endangered Swamp Stringybark ( Eucalyptus conglomerata ) with its many trunks , gray , fibrous bark and bunches of white flowers . 

Many amphibians live in the park , including the nearly endangered Tusked Frog ( Adelotus brevis ) and the endangered or threatened Green - thighed frog , Wallum froglet , and Giant barred frog . 

About 70 different bird species have been observed in the park , including the almost endangered Red - browed treecreeper .
