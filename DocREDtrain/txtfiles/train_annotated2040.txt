Kaaterskill High Peak ( officially just High Peak ) is one of the Catskill Mountains , located in the Town of Hunter in Greene County , New York , United States . 

It was once believed to be the highest peak in the entire range , but its summit , at 3,655 feet ( 1,114 m ) in elevation , places it only 23rd among the Catskill High Peaks . 

It is , however , the fourth most prominent peak in the range . 

Due to its situation as the easternmost High Peak , it is also the only one completely outside the watersheds of New York City 's reservoirs in the region . 

Along with Round Top to the west , its distinctive ridgeline is a visual signature of the Catskills . 

Even today , it dominates the view of the range from the Hudson Valley . 

In the early 19th century , it was a frequent subject of works by Thomas Cole and other artists of the Hudson River school . 

Their works helped establish the Catskill Mountain House and other hotels around North - South Lake as the fashionable summer vacation spot for wealthy Americans of the era . 

Despite that popularity , the mountain was admired from afar more often than it was climbed . 

Although it boasts the earliest recorded ascent of any Catskill peak , today it seems somewhat neglected , lacking an official trail to its summit . 

However , a well - used path does exist , and perhaps because of the light use the mountain gets it is very popular with the area 's serious hikers , due to the views available from Hurricane Ledge south of the summit , and several other points of interest in the vicinity of the mountain .
