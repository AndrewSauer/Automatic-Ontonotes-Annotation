Fall River ( 2011 population : 11,526 ) is a suburban community in Halifax , Nova Scotia , Canada . 

It is located north - northeast of the Bedford Basin , northeast of Bedford and Lower Sackville and north of Waverley . 

Fall River 's name is derived from a stream running between Miller Lake and Lake Thomas which had a waterfall . 

These falls supplied water power for several mills during the 19th century as well as a local electrical utility during the early 20th century . 

The waterfall was demolished in the late 1950s as a result of the construction of the Bicentennial Highway leading to Halifax ; the waterfall was located where the 4-lane expressway currently runs up the hill from the crossing of Lake Thomas to the interchange with Highway 118 at Miller Lake . 

Hydro - electric power is now generated by an underground tunnel that carries the water from Miller Lake which once flowed through this stream and down the waterfall . 

Turbines produce electricity for the main grid , during peak periods .
