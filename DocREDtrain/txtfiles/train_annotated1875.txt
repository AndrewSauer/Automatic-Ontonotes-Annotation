Q Planes ( known as Clouds Over Europe in the United States ) is a 1939 British comedy spy film starring Ralph Richardson , Laurence Olivier and Valerie Hobson . 

Olivier and Richardson were a decade into their 50-year friendship and theatrical collaboration and had just completed Othello , with Richardson in the title role and Olivier as Iago , when this film was made . 

The film was produced by Irving Asher , an American , with British film impresario Alexander Korda as executive producer . 

The name Q Planes may have been derived from the British " Q - ships " , armed ships disguised as merchantmen , used in the First World War as decoys to lure German U - boats . 

The film was directed by American director Tim Whelan ( Sidewalks of London and later in 1940 , co - director of The Thief of Bagdad ) , who had been in Britain since 1932 , working for Korda at Denham Studios .
