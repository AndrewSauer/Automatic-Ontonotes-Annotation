The Raz de Sein is a stretch of water located between the Isle of Sein and the Pointe du Raz in Finistère in the Brittany region of France . 

This tidal water is an essential passage for vessels wishing to pass between the Atlantic and the English Channel , because further west at high tide the Isle of Sein and its embankment stretch for more than thirty miles . 

This is a very dangerous zone for navigation due to the violent sea currents from the tides ( up to six knots during the spring tides ) . 

The current causes the sea to rise quickly , and it is recommended that heavy vessels should only attempt to cross this strait at still water during calmer conditions . 

The Raz de Sein is bounded by the La Vieille and Petite Vieille lighthouses and by the shoreline of the île de Sein .
