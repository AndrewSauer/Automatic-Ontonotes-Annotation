Kick Ass : Music from the Motion Picture is the soundtrack to the film of the same name . 

It was released in the United Kingdom on 29 March 2010 , and in the United States on iTunes on 30 March 2010 . 

The title song is sung by Mika , co - written by Jodi Marr and produced by RedOne . 

The video for the single shows Mika as a helpless individual left in an alleyway after being mugged . 

He begins to sing and as he does , the words of empowerment in the lyrics and his finding of an issue of the Kick - Ass comic inspire him to run for the rooftops and wail the chorus to the sky . 

The video also features intercut scenes from the film . 

The song " Stand Up " by The Prodigy is featured in both the teaser trailer and the red band trailer . 

A song featured in the film , but not on the soundtrack is " Crazy " , by Gnarls Barkley . 

This song is played in the Mistmobile while Kick - Ass and Red Mist cruise around town together . 

Also , the version of " Bad Reputation " used in the film was by Joan Jett but the version on the soundtrack is by a band called " The Hit Girls " . 

The song " Hey Little World " by The Hives , which played in the theatrical trailers was also not included .
