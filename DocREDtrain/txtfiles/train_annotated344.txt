The geography of Antarctica is dominated by its south polar location and , thus , by ice . 

The Antarctic continent , located in the Earth 's southern hemisphere , is centered asymmetrically around the South Pole and largely south of the Antarctic Circle . 

It is washed by the Southern ( or Antarctic ) Ocean or , depending on definition , the southern Pacific , Atlantic , and Indian Oceans . 

It has an area of more than 14 million   km² . 

Some 98 % of Antarctica is covered by the Antarctic ice sheet , the world 's largest ice sheet and also its largest reservoir of fresh water . 

Averaging at least 1.6   km thick , the ice is so massive that it has depressed the continental bedrock in some areas more than 2.5   km below sea level ; subglacial lakes of liquid water also occur ( e.g. , Lake Vostok ) . 

Ice shelves and rises populate the ice sheet on the periphery . 

In September 2018 , researchers at the National Geospatial - Intelligence Agency released a high resolution terrain map ( detail down to the size of a car , and less in some areas ) of Antarctica , named the " Reference Elevation Model of Antarctica " ( REMA ) .
