The Devon and Cornwall County Division was a County Division of the British Army created during the Second World War . 

It was formed on 28 February 1941 , from recently recruited soldiers , in response to the renewed threat of a German invasion . 

The 10,000-strong division was a static formation , lacking transport , intended to defend possible landing sites along the southern Cornish and Devon coastlines from invading German troops . 

The creation of the division also helped to free up the more experienced troops , who were then held back from the coastline to be able to launch a counterattack against any potential German landings . 

During mid-1941 , Germany launched a massive invasion of the Soviet Union , which practically eliminated the threat of an invasion of the United Kingdom . 

Consequently , the division never saw service in its intended role . 

With the threat of a German invasion lifted , the British Army began a series of reforms intended to restore balance to the then infantry - heavy organisation . 

As a result , all nine county divisions were disbanded . 

The Devon and Cornwall County Division ceased to exist on 1 December , but was subsequently reformed as the 77th Infantry Division .
