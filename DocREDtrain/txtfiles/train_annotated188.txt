The Lycée Hoche is a public secondary school located in Versailles , not very far away from the famous Palace of Versailles . 

Formerly , it had been a nunnery founded by French queen Marie Leszczyńska . 

However , after the French Revolution , it became a school in 1803 . 

In 1888 , the school was named " Lycée Hoche " after the French general Lazare Hoche who was born in Versailles . 

Together with Lycée Henri - IV , Lycée Louis - le - Grand , Lycée Stanislas and Lycée Sainte - Geneviève , the Lycée Hoche is one of the most prestigious schools in France for undergraduate education . 

Each year , scores of students coming from its preparatory classes are admitted to France 's most renowned graduate schools , such as the École Polytechnique , the École Normale Supérieure , HEC Paris and ESSEC Business School . 

The 200 years history of this school can be found in the recent book ( June 2010 ) written by the French teacher Marie - Louise Mercier - Jouve : " Le lycee Hoche de Versailles , deux cents ans d'histoire " edited by Patrice Dupuy 's editions , Paris .
