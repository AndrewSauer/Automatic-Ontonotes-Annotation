Jan Joost van Cossiau ( c.1660 – 1732 ) was a Flemish landscape painter and engraver who was born near Breda . 

He spent most of his career in Frankfurt am Main . 

His landscapes usually include people , and also often buildings and cattle . 

They are in the “ Italian style ” and generally resemble those of Gaspard Dughet ( 1613 – 1675 ) . 

Cossiau worked for Lothar Franz von Schönborn at his electoral court , as well as at his Schloss Weißenstein ( castle ) . 

He was also director of the electoral gallery at Pommersfelden , where he established the final directory of paintings , after the first survey by Johann Rudolph Bys . 

In order to extend his gallery , Lothar Franz sent his two gallery directors often to the Netherlands and Italy . 

Jan Joost van Cossiau died in Mainz in 1732 .
