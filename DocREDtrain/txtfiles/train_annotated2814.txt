Haakon Steen Lie ( 22 September 1905 – 25 May 2009 ) was a Norwegian politician who served as party secretary for the Norwegian Labour Party from 1945 to 1969 . 

Coming from humble origins , he became involved in the labour movement at an early age , and quickly rose in the party system . 

After actively working for the resistance movement and the exiled government during World War II , he was elected to the second - highest position in the party after the war , and his years in office were the most successful in the party 's history . 

Lie is widely considered – along with Einar Gerhardsen – to be the architect of the post - war success of the Labour Party , and of the Norwegian welfare state . 

At the same time , he has also been the subject of criticism for organising surveillance of Norwegian opposition figures , in particular communists . 

Lie remained active in Norwegian public life , even after his 100th birthday , and in 2008 he celebrated his 103rd birthday with the release of a new biography , " Slik jeg ser det nå " ( As I see it now ) .
