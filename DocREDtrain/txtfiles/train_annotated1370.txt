The Google Assistant is an artificial intelligence - powered virtual assistant developed by Google that is primarily available on mobile and smart home devices . 

Unlike the company 's previous virtual assistant , Google Now , the Google Assistant can engage in two - way conversations . 

Assistant initially debuted in May 2016 as part of Google 's messaging app Allo , and its voice - activated speaker Google Home . 

After a period of exclusivity on the Pixel and Pixel XL smartphones , it began to be deployed on other Android devices in February 2017 , including third - party smartphones and Android Wear ( now Wear OS ) , and was released as a standalone app on the iOS operating system in May. 

Alongside the announcement of a software development kit in April 2017 , the Assistant has been , and is being , further extended to support a large variety of devices , including cars and smart home appliances . 

The functionality of the Assistant can also be enhanced by third - party developers . 

Users primarily interact with the Google Assistant through natural voice , though keyboard input is also supported . 

In the same nature and manner as Google Now , the Assistant is able to search the Internet , schedule events and alarms , adjust hardware settings on the user 's device , and show information from the user 's Google account . 

Google has also announced that the Assistant will be able to identify objects and gather visual information through the device 's camera , and support purchasing products and sending money , as well as identifying songs . 

At CES 2018 , the first Assistant - powered smart displays ( smart speakers with video screens ) were announced , with the first one being released in July 2018 .
