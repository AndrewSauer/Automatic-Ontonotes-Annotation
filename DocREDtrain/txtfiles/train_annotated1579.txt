Nelson 's Column is a monument in Trafalgar Square in central London built to commemorate Admiral Horatio Nelson , who died at the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805 . 

The monument was constructed between 1840 and 1843 to a design by William Railton at a cost of £ 47,000 . 

It is a column of the Corinthian order built from Dartmoor granite . 

The Craigleith sandstone statue of Nelson is by E.H. Baily , and the four bronze lions on the base , added in 1867 , were designed by Sir Edwin Landseer . 

The pedestal is decorated with four bronze relief panels , each square , cast from captured French guns . 

They depict the Battle of Cape St Vincent , the Battle of the Nile , the Battle of Copenhagen , and the death of Nelson at Trafalgar . 

The sculptors were Musgrave Watson , William F. Woodington , John Ternouth , and John Edward Carew , respectively . 

It was refurbished in 2006 at a cost of £ 420,000 , at which time it was surveyed and found to be shorter than previously supposed . 

The whole monument is tall from the bottom of the pedestal to the top of Nelson 's hat .
