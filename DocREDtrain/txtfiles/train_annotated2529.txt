Solidarnost ( Солидарность , Russian for " Solidarity " , named after the Polish Solidarność ) is a Russian liberal democratic political movement founded on 13 December 2008 by a number of well - known members of the liberal democratic opposition , including Garry Kasparov , Boris Nemtsov and others from the Yabloko and Union of Right Forces ( which had just merged with two pro - Kremlin parties , the Democratic Party of Russia and Civilian Power , to form the pro - Kremlin liberal democratic Right Cause ) parties , leaders of the Dissenters March events , the Committee 2008 , the People 's Democratic Union , the United Civil Front , The Other Russia and other politicians and political groups . 

In an apparent attempt to weaken the movement immediately before its foundation , President Dmitri Medvedev nominated former leader of the Union of Right Forces Nikita Belykh to become governor of the Kirov Oblast ( Belykh agreed to take the position ) . 

As reported by the International Herald Tribune Belykh " sought to explain his decision by arguing that he could do more good by working with the Kremlin . 

He said he would prove that someone with progressive ideas could succeed in the government " , while saying that " When you have nothing at all , when you can not even get close in the elections , when all your paths are being cut off , then you just ca n't have a political party . "
