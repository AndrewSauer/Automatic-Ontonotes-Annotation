Hans Meiser ( 16 February 1881 , Nuremberg - 8 June 1956 , Munich ) was a German Protestant theologian , pastor and from 1933 to 1955 the first ' Landesbischof ' of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Bavaria . 

Today Meiser 's political stance between 1933 and 1945 is intensely studied and debated within the parameters of Germany 's Culture of Remembrance . 

In his unsuccessful attempt to maintain his ' landeskirche ' and its independence he decided to make several compromises with the Nazi state . 

His attitude towards Judaism is also controversial in light of studies of the Shoah . 

Theologically , Meiser was in the tradition of Wilhelm Loehe , supporting a single church with a single clear Lutheran confessional identity . 

Unlike other Bavarian theology professors such as Werner Elert , Paul Althaus and Hermann Sasse , Meiser explicitly recognized the Barmen Theological Declaration and engaged with the links it brought to Unitarians and the Reformed Church . 

His confessional orientation aligned him with Theophil Wurm and divided him from Martin Niem√∂ller .
