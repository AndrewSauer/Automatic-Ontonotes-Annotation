Wang Zhi ( ) , art name Wufeng ( 五峰 ) , was a Chinese pirate lord of the 16th century , one of the chief named and known figures among the wokou pirates prevalent during the reign of the Jiajing Emperor . 

Originally a salt merchant , Wang Zhi turned to smuggling during the Ming dynasty 's period of maritime prohibitions banning all private overseas trade , and eventually became the head of a pirate syndicate stretching the East and South China Seas , from Japan to Thailand . 

Through his clandestine trade , he is credited for spreading European firearms throughout East Asia , and for his role in leading the first Europeans ( the Portuguese ) to reach Japan in 1543 . 

However , he was also blamed for the ravages of the Jiajing wokou raids in China , and was executed in 1560 for that reason while trying to negotiate a relaxation of the Ming maritime prohibitions .
