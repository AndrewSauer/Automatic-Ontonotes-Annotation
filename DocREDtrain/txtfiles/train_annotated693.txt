Sun Meiyao ( simplified Chinese : 孙美瑶 ; traditional Chinese : 孫美搖 ; pinyin : Sūn Měiyáo ; 1898 - 19 December 1923 ) leader of the Shandong Autonomous Army ( 山東自治軍 : pinyin ; Shāndōng zìzhì jūn ) , also known as the Shandong Outlaws ( 山東響馬 ) , a group of bandits operating in Jiangsu , Anhui , and Shandong provinces in the early 1920s . 

He is most famous for leading his bandits in the seizure and robbery of the " Blue Express " train near the town of Lincheng on 6 May 1923 , and taking over 300 hostages , including 30 westerners . 

The incident , which became known as the Lincheng Outrage , embarrassed China 's fragile republican government , forcing it to respond to demands of western governments that it increase security along the country 's extensive rail network and pay compensation and indemnities to western hostages .
