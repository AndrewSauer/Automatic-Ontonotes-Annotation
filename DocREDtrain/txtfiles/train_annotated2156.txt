Kusići ( Cyrillic : Кусићи ) was formerly a subvillage ( ) of the village Jezera , Teslić , Bosnia and Herzegovina . 

After the collapse and dissolution of Yugoslavia and during the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina from 1992 to 1995 , reportedly all its inhabitants left their homes and moved mostly to Vojvodina , Serbia . 

Among the reasons for this exodus was the newly established geopolitical order in Bosnia a Herzegovina . 

The border between the two Bosnian " entities , " i.e. 

the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and Republika Srpska , runs through the village Jezera . 

Jezera 's Orthodox Christian Kusići population left their homes ; the area 's borders have been redrawn and the village is now under the jurisdiction of the Zenica municipality , Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina .
