Destroyer escort ( DE ) was the United States Navy mid-20th - century classification for a warship designed with endurance to escort mid - ocean convoys of merchant marine ships . 

Kaibōkan were designed for a similar role in the Imperial Japanese Navy . 

The Royal Navy and Commonwealth forces identified such warships as frigates , and that classification was widely accepted when the United States redesignated destroyer escorts as frigates ( FF ) in 1975 . 

Destroyer escorts , frigates , and kaibōkan were mass - produced for World War II as a less expensive antisubmarine warfare alternative to fleet destroyers . 

Other similar warships include the 10 Kriegsmarine escort ships of the F - class and the two Amiral Murgescu - class vessels of the Romanian Navy . 

Postwar destroyer escorts and frigates were larger than those produced during wartime , with increased antiaircraft capability , but remained smaller and slower than postwar destroyers . 

As Cold War destroyer escorts became as large as wartime destroyers , the United States Navy converted some of their World War II destroyers to escort destroyers ( DDE ) .
