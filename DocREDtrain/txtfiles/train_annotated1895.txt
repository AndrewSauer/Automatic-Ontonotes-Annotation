The Ivy League public policy schools outlines the universities within the Ivy League that offer public policy or public administration degrees . 

These public policy schools often provide Bachelor of Arts ( BA ) , Master of Public Policy ( MPP ) , Master of Public Administration ( MPA ) , Master of International Affairs , or Doctor of Philosophy in Public Policy and/or Administration degrees . 

The public policy programs at the Ivy League rank as some of the best in the world . 

The oldest program for the study of public policy and administration began at Princeton University in 1930 , founded as the School of Public and International Affairs . 

The school 's mission was to prepare students for " leadership in public and international affairs " in accordance with President Woodrow Wilson who desired a school that could train students for public service . 

Harvard University soon followed with their own school , the Graduate School of Public Administration , in 1936 . 

The most recently established school of government was at Yale University through the Jackson Institute for Global Affairs in 2010 . 

The goal of the Jackson Institute was to enhance the university 's current offerings of social science research and courses . 

The Institute currently specializes in international affairs , but is planning to expand to domestic policy in the near future . 

These schools have served as the model for other programs around the world , most notably at Oxford University . 

The Blavatnik School of Government was founded in 2010 and is the first of its kind in Europe . 

It currently offers MPP and DPhil in Public Policy degrees . 

Pundits believe the Blavatnik School seeks to differentiate itself with a more well - rounded curriculum , thereby competing with the American monopoly on public policy schools .
