The waterfall is accessible from the Historic Columbia River Highway and Interstate 84 . 

Spanning two tiers on basalt cliffs , it is the tallest waterfall in the state of Oregon at in height . 

The land surrounding the falls was developed by Simon Benson in the early - twentieth century , with a pathway , viewing bridge , and adjacent lodge being constructed in 1925 . 

The Multnomah Falls Lodge and the surrounding footpaths at the falls were added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1981 .
