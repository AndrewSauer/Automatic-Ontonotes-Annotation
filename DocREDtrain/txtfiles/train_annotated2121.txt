Four cardinal virtues were recognized in classical antiquity and in traditional Christian theology : 

Prudence ( , phronēsis ; ; also Wisdom , Sophia , sapientia ) , the ability to discern the appropriate course of action to be taken in a given situation at the appropriate time . 

Courage ( , andreia ; ): also termed fortitude , forbearance , strength , endurance , and the ability to confront fear , uncertainty , and intimidation 

Temperance ( , sōphrosynē ; ): also known as restraint , the practice of self - control , abstention , discretion , and moderation tempering the appetition . 

Sōphrosynē can also be translated as sound - mindedness . 

Justice ( , dikaiosynē ; ): also considered as fairness , the most extensive and most important virtue ; the Greek word also having the meaning righteousness 

These virtues derive initially from Plato 's scheme , discussed in Republic Book IV , 426 – 435 ( and see Protagoras 330b , which also includes piety ( hosiotes ) ) . 

Cicero expanded on them , and Ambrose , Augustine of Hippo , and Thomas Aquinas adapted them while adding a set of theological virtues . 

The term cardinal comes from the Latin ( hinge ) ; virtues are so called because they are regarded as the basic virtues required for a virtuous life . 

They also relate to the Quadrivium .
