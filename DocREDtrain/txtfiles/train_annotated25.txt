Chelsea was an early 1970s band from New York City , best known for being the band of drummer Peter Criss before he joined Kiss . 

They released one album , the self - titled album Chelsea in 1971 and then collapsed during the recording of their unreleased second album . 

In August 1971 , the band became Lips ( a trio consisting of Criss and his Chelsea bandmates Michael Benvenga and Stan Penridge ) . 

By the spring of 1973 , Lips was just the duo of Criss and Penridge and eventually disbanded completely .
