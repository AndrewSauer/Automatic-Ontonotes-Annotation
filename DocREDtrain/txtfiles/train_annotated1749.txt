Elaine Marley â€“ Threepwood is a fictional character in the Monkey Island series of graphic adventure video games . 

Created by Ron Gilbert for LucasArts , the character first appears in The Secret of Monkey Island and is one of the core characters in the franchise . 

Originally conceived as a ruthless island governor , the character evolved during development into the protagonist 's love interest . 

While the first two games in the series did not feature voice acting , Elaine was voiced by Alexandra Boyd in The Curse of Monkey Island and by Charity James in Escape from Monkey Island ; Boyd would reprise the role for later entries in the franchise . 

Elaine is the governor of the Tri - Island Area , a fictional group of pirate islands in the Caribbean . 

She is loved by the undead pirate LeChuck , who never ceases to pursue her affections and attempts to turn her into his undead bride , but Elaine instead falls in love with hapless protagonist Guybrush Threepwood . 

Elaine is consistently kidnapped by LeChuck , prompting Guybrush to attempt a rescue , although Elaine is usually more than capable of escaping predicaments by herself . 

She eventually marries Guybrush and relinquishes her gubernatorial responsibilities to her grandfather , travelling with Guybrush to the fictional Gulf of Melange to cure the outbreak of a voodoo - empowered pox . 

The character has enjoyed positive critical reception . 

Several sources commended Elaine 's aberration of the damsel in distress stereotype . 

Elaine has been ranked on a number of lists regarding the best female characters in the video game industry , and has received praise for her visual design and resilient personality . 

Critics have also complimented Boyd 's and James ' voice acting for the character in the later installments of the series , though some expressed disappointment at the character 's reduced lines in The Curse of Monkey Island .
