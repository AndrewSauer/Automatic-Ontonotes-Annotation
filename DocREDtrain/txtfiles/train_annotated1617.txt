Data rescue is a name for both a movement among scientists , researchers and others and the processes they use to preserve primarily government - hosted data sets , often scientific in nature , to ward off their removal from publicly available websites . 

While the concept of preserving federal data existed before , it gained new impetus with the election in 2016 of U.S. President Donald Trump . 

The concept of harvesting and preserving federal web pages began as early as 2008 , at the conclusion of President George W. Bush 's second term , under the name " End of Term Presidential Harvest . " 

Soon after Trump 's election , scientists , librarians and others in the U.S. and Canada — fearing that the administration of Trump ( who had expressed doubts about the validity of the scientific consensus on the existence of climate change ) would act to remove scientific data from government websites — began working to preserve that data . 

In quick order , the concept of Data Rescue became a grassroots movement , with organized " hackathon " events at cities across the U.S. and elsewhere , often hosted at universities and other institutions of higher education . 

Among the projects involved are the DataRefuge Project and the Environmental Data and Governance Initiative .
