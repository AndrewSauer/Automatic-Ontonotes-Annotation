The Royal Victorian Order is an order of knighthood awarded by the sovereign of the United Kingdom and several Commonwealth realms . 

It is granted personally by the monarch and recognises personal service to the monarchy , the Royal Household , royal family members , and the organisation of important royal events . 

The order was officially created and instituted on 23 April 1896 by letters patent under the Great Seal of the Realm by Queen Victoria . 

It was instituted with five grades , Knight Grand Cross ( GCVO ) , Knight Commander ( KCVO ) , Commander ( CVO ) , Member ( fourth class ) and Member ( fifth class ) , the last two of which were abbreviated to MVO . 

The two highest conferred the status of knighthood on holders ; in 1984 , the grade of Member ( fourth class ) was renamed Lieutenant ( LVO ) , and holders of the fifth grade became Members . 

Women were not admitted until 1936 ; those receiving the highest two awards were styled Dames and those grades , when conferred on women , are Dame Grand Cross and Dame Commander ( DCVO ) . 

The order could also be conferred on foreigners , who were typically appointed to honorary grades and were thus not entitled to the styles , such as Sir and Dame , associated with ordinary grades .
