The Hudson Bay expedition of Jean - François de Galaup , comte de La Pérouse was a series of military raids on the lucrative fur trading posts and fortifications of the Hudson 's Bay Company on the shores of Hudson Bay by a squadron of the French Royal Navy . 

Setting sail from Cap - Français in 1782 , the expedition was part of a global naval war between France and Great Britain during the American Revolutionary War . 

Operating under secret orders from the Marquis de Castries , France 's marine minister , La Pérouse sailed from Cap - Français in May 1782 , and arrived at the Prince of Wales Fort in early August . 

That fort and York Factory trading post both surrendered without a fight , although some of the furs stored at York were spirited away by a company ship that evaded the French fleet . 

Many of the British prisoners were put on a sloop and allowed to sail back to England . 

Men on La Pérouse 's fleet , which had sailed with minimal winter provisioning to maintain secrecy , suffered hardships including scurvy and other diseases . 

Hudson 's Bay Company finances suffered because of the raid , which also contributed to reductions in the native population that did business with the company .
