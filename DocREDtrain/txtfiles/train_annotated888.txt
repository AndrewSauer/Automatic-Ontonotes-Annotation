WhatDoTheyKnow is a site by mySociety designed to help people in the United Kingdom make Freedom of Information requests . 

It publishes both the requests and the authoritiesâ€™ responses online , with the aim of making information available to all , and of removing the need for multiple people to make the same requests . 

The site acts as a permanent public archive of FOI requests made through it . 

Around 15 % to 20 % of requests to UK Central Government are made through WhatDoTheyKnow.com . 

Over 16,800 public bodies have been added to the site , mainly by volunteers . 

More than 294,000 requests have been made using the site and more than 4.5 million people visited it in 2014 

WhatDoTheyKnow has been described by The Guardian as " an idiot 's guide to making a freedom of information request . " 

The Information Commissioner 's Office has stated that it believes " the most up - to - date informal list of all public authorities is held on the website " . 

Information released through the site has given rise to serious and less serious news stories . 

The site is used by a number of MPs . 

The site was originally available only in English but a partially translated Welsh version was added in 2013 .
