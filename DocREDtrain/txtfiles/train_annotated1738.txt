Rinôçérôse ( stylized as rinôçérôse or « rinôçérôse » ) is a French band founded by Jean - Philippe Freu and Patrice Carrié that mixes rock music and electronic dance music . 

The duo of musicians also work as psychologists , calling themselves , " Psychologists by day , musicians by night " . 

They compose music in English , French , and German . 

They are based in Montpellier ( Occitanie ) . 

" Le Mobilier " was the single that established Rinôçérôse on the map of international dance music . 

The song " Cubicle " , from their album , Schizophonia , was featured on a television advertisement for Apple 's iTunes and iPod . 

Schizophonia marks a new turning point in the band 's music , with a more mainstream rock groove rather than a more ambient electronic sound . 

Schizophonia also contains an unprecedented amount of vocals compared to previous albums , in which lyrics are used extremely sparingly , or not at all . 

The band has released an eponymous greatest hits album , named Rinôçérôse ( only differentiated from their first album by the diacritics ) . 

Rinôçérôse contains hit singles such as " Bitch " , " Cubicle " , " Music Kills Me " , and " My Demons " . 

Rinôçérôse released their most recent album Futurinô in 2009 . 

Their song " La Guitaristic House Organisation " was featured in the soundtrack of the video game NHL 2000 by EA Sports .
