École Polytechnique (; also known as EP or X ) is a French public institution of higher education and research in Palaiseau , a suburb southwest of Paris . 

It is one of the most prestigious and selective French grandes écoles . 

It is known for its polytechnicien engineering degree programme . 

The school was established in 1794 by the mathematician Gaspard Monge during the French Revolution , and was a military academy under Napoleon I in 1804 . 

Although Polytechnique is no longer a military academy , the school is still supervised by the French ministry of defense , and only a small number of its students choose to pursue a military career . 

Initially located in the Latin Quarter of central Paris , the school 's main buildings were moved in 1976 to Palaiseau on the Saclay Plateau . 

Polytechnique has engaged in several partnerships to improve its international renown . 

It is a founding member of ParisTech , a grouping of leading engineering colleges in the Paris region established in 2007 . 

In 2014 it also became a founding member of the confederal University of Paris - Saclay . 

Among its alumni are three Nobel prize winners , three Presidents of France and many CEOs of French and international companies . 

As of 2018 , it is associated with 4 Fields Medal winners and is also currently ranked as the world 's third - best small university by Times Higher Education 's World University Rankings . 

During the 19th century , the specific model of École Polytechnique inspired the foundation of other well - known schools also named " Polytechnic , " such as Polytechnique Montréal and Caltech ( initially a vocational school named the Throop " Polytechnic " Institute ) .
