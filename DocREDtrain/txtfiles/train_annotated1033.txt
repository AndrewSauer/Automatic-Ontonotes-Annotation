The Pennsylvanian ( also known as Upper Carboniferous or Late Carboniferous ) is , in the ICS geologic timescale , the younger of two subperiods ( or upper of two subsystems ) of the Carboniferous Period . 

It lasted from roughly Ma ( million years ago ) . 

As with most other geochronologic units , the rock beds that define the Pennsylvanian are well identified , but the exact date of the start and end are uncertain by a few hundred thousand years . 

The Pennsylvanian is named after the U.S. state of Pennsylvania , where the coal - productive beds of this age are widespread . 

The division between Pennsylvanian and Mississippian comes from North American stratigraphy . 

In North America , where the early Carboniferous beds are primarily marine limestones , the Pennsylvanian was in the past treated as a full - fledged geologic period between the Mississippian and the Permian . 

In Europe , the Mississippian and Pennsylvanian are one more - or - less continuous sequence of lowland continental deposits and are grouped together as the Carboniferous Period . 

The current internationally used geologic timescale of the ICS gives the Mississippian and Pennsylvanian the rank of subperiods , subdivisions of the Carboniferous Period .
