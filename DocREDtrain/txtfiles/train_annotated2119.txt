The BPF Party ( or PBNF ) , is a political party in Belarus . 

It was de - facto established after the split of the social movement Belarusian Popular Front or BPF ( or БНФ ( ) in 1999 . 

The Belarusian Popular Front was founded during the Perestroika era by members of the Belarusian intelligentsia , including Vasil Bykaŭ . 

Its first and most charismatic leader was Zianon Pazniak . 

After a 2005 decree by president Alexander Lukashenko on the restriction of the usage of the words Беларускі ( " Belarusian " ) and " Народны " ( " National " , " Popular " , " People 's " ) in the names of political parties and movements , the party had to change its official name to " BPF Party " .
