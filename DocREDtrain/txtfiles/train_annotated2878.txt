Sergio Claudio Cirigliano is an Argentinian businessman who , with his brother Mario , operates major rail and bus concessions in Buenos Aires and elsewhere in Argentina through the Grupo Plaza conglomerate . 

One source has described the brothers as making up “ one of the most powerful business groups in the country . ” 

Cirigliano and his brother were widely held responsible for the deadly Once railway disaster in February 2012 , which occurred on one of the railway lines that they ran , because they had allegedly pocketed government subsidies intended to cover maintenance costs . 

Grupo Plaza was said to have been awarded concessions for rail and bus lines because of Cirigliano 's close friendships with Presidents Carlos Menem , Nestor Kirchner , and Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner . 

Also , Cirigliano was accused of having bribed Secretaries of Transportation Ricardo Jaime and Juan Pablo Schiavi , who directly oversaw the awarding of rail and bus concessions . 

Later in 2012 , both Cirigliano and his brother Mario went on trial on charges of corruption and fraudulent administration in connection with the Once crash . 

La Nación described him as the “ successful driver of the K line , ” the “ K ” being a sardonic reference to his close connections to the Kirchner family .
