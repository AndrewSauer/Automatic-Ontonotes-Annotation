Lech Majewski ( pronounced , ‘ Ma - yev - ski’ ) ( born 30 August 1953 ) is a Polish film and theatre director , writer , poet , and painter . 

Born in Katowice , Poland , Majewski studied at the Academy of Fine Arts in Warsaw . 

In the 1970s , he then studied at the National Film School in Łódź , notably as a student of Wojciech Has , who taught Majewski directing . 

In the early 80s , after completing The Knight and as martial law was declared in Poland , Majewski emigrated to England and then to the United States , where he lived for most of the late Communist era . 

Majewski is a dual U.S .- Polish citizen , and travels often between those and other countries . 

He is a member of the American and European film academies and the Polish International PEN . 

Majewski speaks fluent , and excellent , English , but often works with English - speaking natives on his script . 

That was the initial role that Julian Schnabel had on Basquiat , before Majewski abandoned the project and Schnabel took it over . 

In 2006 , the Museum of Modern Art in New York City hosted a retrospective of Majewski 's work . 

This was their first ever full retrospective of a Polish filmmaker , and one of their only ever mid - career retrospectives . 

For that program , Majewski created the film eventually called Glass Lips , though initially it was known as Blood of a Poet .
