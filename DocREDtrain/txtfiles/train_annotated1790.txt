Nicolaus Mameranus ( 6 December 1500 – 1567 ) was a Luxembourgian soldier and historian under Charles V , for whom he travelled widely , recording faithfully the composition of foreign courts and the customs of foreign countries . 

All his writings are in Latin . 

Mameranus was born in Mamer , probably as Nik Wagener . 

He was a very conservative Roman Catholic , full of abuse for Lutherans and other Protestants . 

He succeeded in having Charles V pay for the restoration of his native Mamer after the Duke of Orléans ' troops pillaged it in 1543 . 

In 1555 , Charles V appointed him poet laureate and Count Palatine in recognition of his continued support . 

He probably died in Augsburg , Germany , in 1567 .
