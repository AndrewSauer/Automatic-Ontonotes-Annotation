Surrealist cinema is a modernist approach to film theory , criticism , and production with origins in Paris in the 1920s . 

The movement used shocking , irrational , or absurd imagery and Freudian dream symbolism to challenge the traditional function of art to represent reality . 

Related to Dada cinema , Surrealist cinema is characterized by juxtapositions , the rejection of dramatic psychology , and a frequent use of shocking imagery . 

Philippe Soupault and André Breton ’s 1920 book collaboration Les Champs Magnétiques is often considered to be the first Surrealist work , but it was only once Breton had completed his Surrealist Manifesto in 1924 that ‘ Surrealism drafted itself an official birth certificate.’ 

The first Surrealist film was The Seashell and the Clergyman from 1928 , directed by Germaine Dulac from a screenplay by Antonin Artaud . 

Other films include Un Chien Andalou and L'Age d'Or by Luis Buñuel and Salvador Dalí ; Buñuel went on to direct many more films , with varying degrees of Surrealist influence .
