The Great Bear Lake (; Slavey : Sahtú ; ) is the largest lake entirely in Canada ( Lake Superior and Lake Huron straddling the Canada – US border are larger ) , the fourth - largest in North America , and the eighth - largest in the world . 

The lake is in the Northwest Territories , on the Arctic Circle between 65 and 67 degrees of northern latitude and between 118 and 123 degrees western longitude , above sea level . 

The name originated from the Dënesųłiné word satudene , meaning " grizzly bear water people . " 

The Sahtu Dene people are named after the lake . 

Grizzly Bear Mountain on the shore of the lake also comes from Denesuline , meaning , " bear large hill . " 

The Sahoyue ( Grizzly Bear Mountain ) peninsula on the south side of the lake and the Edacho ( Scented Grass Hills ) peninsula on the west side form the Saoyú-ʔehdacho National Historic Site of Canada .
