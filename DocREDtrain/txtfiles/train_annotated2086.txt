Auisle or Óisle ( or ; died c. 867 ) was a Viking leader in Ireland and Scotland in the mid - late ninth century . 

He was the son of the king of Lochlann , identified in the non - contemporary Fragmentary Annals of Ireland as Gofraid , and brother of Amlaíb Conung and Ímar , the latter of whom founded the Uí Ímair dynasty , and whose descendants would go on to dominate the Irish Sea region for several centuries . 

Another Viking leader , Halfdan Ragnarsson , is sometimes considered a brother . 

The Irish Annals title Auisle , Ímar and Amlaíb " kings of the foreigners " . 

Modern scholars use the title " kings of Dublin " after the Viking settlement which formed the base of their power . 

Auisle is mentioned three times in contemporary annals . 

In the first entry , dated 863 , he and his brothers are recorded as having raided Brega , including underground tombs at Achad Aldai , Cnodba , and Dubad . 

The second , dated 866 , records Auisle and Amlaíb raiding Pictland , taking away many hostages . 

In the final entry , dated 867 , the death of Auisle at the hands of unnamed kinsmen is reported . 

According to the later Fragmentary Annals his brothers Amlaíb and Ímar plotted his death , with Amlaíb striking the killing blow .
