Salmo aphelios is a species of trout , a salmonid fish endemic to Lake Ohrid in Macedonia and Albania in the Balkans . 

S. aphelios is one of four different forms of the Ohrid trout complex within the single lake , along with S. balcanicus , S. letnica , and S. lumi . 

The various trout forms , which have been suggested to be different species , are distinguished by their breeding time and habitat , by which they in practice are thought to be reproductively isolated from each other . 

Genetic data have not supported their distinction , though . 

S. aphelios specifically spawns from May to July near the underwater springs on the eastern shore of the lake , at the Macedonian - Albanian border area . 

Its flesh is typically of orange colour . 

Overall , the Ohrid trouts are silvery in colour , with black dots . 

Red dots occur along the lateral line . 

S. aphelios can grow to 40 Â  cm long .
