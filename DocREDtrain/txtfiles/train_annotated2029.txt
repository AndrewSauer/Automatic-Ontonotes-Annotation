Storm tides of the North Sea are coastal floods associated with low pressure weather systems in the North Sea , the severity of which are affected by the shallowness of the sea and the orientation of the shoreline relative to the storm 's path , as well as the timing of tides . 

The water level can rise to more than 5   metres ( 17   ft ) above the normal tide as a result of storm tides . 

Northern Germany and Denmark are particularly susceptible to storm tides . 

The coastline of the German Bight forms an L - shape facing northwest . 

Also vulnerable are the United Kingdom and the Netherlands , where the sea shallows and is funnelled toward the English Channel . 

Storm tides are a regular occurrence in the North Sea basin ; several form each year . 

Although most do not cause significant damage , the impact of some has been devastating . 

During one , the February flood of 1825 , the Danish coastline changed , as the North Jutlandic Island became separated from the Jutland Peninsula .
