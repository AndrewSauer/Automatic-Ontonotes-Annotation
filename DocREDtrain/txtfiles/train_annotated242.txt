The courts of quarter sessions or quarter sessions were local courts traditionally held at four set times each year in the Kingdom of England ( including Wales ) from 1388 until 1707 , then in 18th - century Great Britain , in the later United Kingdom , and in other dominions of the British Empire . 

Quarter sessions generally sat in the seat of each county and county borough . 

They were abolished in England and Wales in 1972 , when the Courts Act 1971 replaced them and the assizes with a single permanent Crown Court . 

In Scotland they survived until 1975 , when they were abolished and replaced by district courts and later by justice of the peace courts . 

The quarter sessions were named after the quarter days on which they met in England and Wales from 1388 . 

These days were later settled as Epiphany , Easter , Midsummer , and Michaelmas sessions .
