It is the second - oldest Slavic Orthodox Church in the world ( after the Bulgarian Orthodox Church ) . 

The Serbian Orthodox Church comprises the majority of the population in Serbia , Montenegro , and the Republika Srpska entity of Bosnia and Herzegovina . 

It is organized into metropolises and eparchies located primarily in Serbia , Bosnia and Herzegovina , Montenegro , and Croatia , but also all over the world where Serb diaspora lives . 

The Serbian Orthodox Church is an autocephalous , or ecclesiastically independent , member of the Eastern Orthodox communion . 

Serbian Patriarch serves as first among equals in his church ; the current patriarch is Irinej . 

The Church achieved autocephalous status in 1219 under the leadership of St. Sava , becoming independent Archbishopric of Žiča . 

Its status was elevated to that of a patriarchate in 1346 , and was known afterwards as the Serbian Patriarchate of Peć . 

This patriarchate was abolished by the Ottoman Turks in 1766 . 

The modern Serbian Orthodox Church was re - established in 1920 after the unification of the Patriarchate of Karlovci , the Metropolitanate of Belgrade and the Metropolitanate of Montenegro .
