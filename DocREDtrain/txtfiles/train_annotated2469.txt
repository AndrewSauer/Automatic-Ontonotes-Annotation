" I 'm Real " is the name of two songs recorded by American singer Jennifer Lopez , both primarily for her second studio album J.Lo ( 2001 ) . 

The original version was released as the album 's fourth single ; Ja Rule of Murder Inc Records wrote and was featured on a new version of the song entitled " I 'm Real ( Murder Remix ) " , which was featured on a re - issue of J.Lo in July 2001 , on Lopez 's remix album J to tha L â€“ O ! 

The Remixes ( 2002 ) , and Ja Rule 's third studio album Pain Is Love ( 2001 ) . 

The original album version was well received by music critics , who complimented the 1980s - esque style and composition , while the remix received mixed reviews for its lyrics . 

However , both songs have been appreciated for the use of the samples . 

The " Murder Remix " topped the Billboard Hot 100 for five non - consecutive weeks , beginning September 8 , 2001 , and also topped the Hot 100 Airplay chart . 

The two songs are essentially different songs with the same title . 

Much controversy followed the song after its release . 

Two music videos were made for the track , with the first depicting Lopez driving a motorcycle throughout the highway and featuring a dance - break , while the second video features Ja Rule and Irv Gotti .
