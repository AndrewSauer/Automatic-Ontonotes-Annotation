The Court of Justice of the European Free Trade Association States ( more commonly known as the EFTA Court ) is a supranational judicial body responsible for the three EFTA members who are also members of the European Economic Area ( EEA ) : Iceland , Liechtenstein and Norway . 

As members of the EEA , the three countries have access to the internal market of the European Union . 

Consequently , they are subject to a number of European laws . 

Enforcement of these laws would normally be carried out by the European Court of Justice ( ECJ ) , however there were legal difficulties in giving Union institutions powers over non - members so the EFTA Court was set up to perform this role instead of the ECJ . 

Since September 1995 , the Court has consisted of three judges and six ad - hoc judges . 

They are nominated by the three members and appointed by their Governments collectively through common accord .
