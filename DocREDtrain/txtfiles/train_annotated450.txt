The Dan Snyder Memorial Award is awarded each year to the player of the Winnipeg Jets who " best embodies perseverance , dedication and hard work without reward or recognition , so that his team and teammates might succeed . " 

The award was created in 2004 , when the franchise was located in Atlanta , to commemorate Atlanta Thrashers forward , Dan Snyder , who died from injuries sustained in an automobile accident in September 2003 . 

A similar award is awarded in the OHL and is known as the Dan Snyder Memorial Trophy . 

Sometimes the Jets ' award is called the same name . 

With the Thrasher 's relocation to Winnipeg , Manitoba to become the Winnipeg Jets following the 2010 - 11 NHL season , there was worry ( by both Thrashers ' fans and those living in Snyder 's hometown ) that Snyder would be forgotten . 

However , Scott Brown , Winnipeg 's director of hockey operations / communications , quelled those fears , revealing that " Craig ( Heisinger ) was in Atlanta and saw all the things they did for Dan Snyder and we are fully prepared and will be honouring everything to do with him . 

Dan Snyder 's friends and family should not worry at all about that . " 

On March 28 , 2012 it was announced that the Jets would continue the tradition of the award . 

The Snyder family was invited to participate in the first ceremony in Winnipeg on the final game of the regular season . 

On April 7 , 2012 , Winnipeg Jets ' defenceman Mark Stuart became the first Winnipeg Jet to be given the memorial award .
