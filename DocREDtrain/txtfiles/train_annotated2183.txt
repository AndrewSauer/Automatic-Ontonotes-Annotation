The Westminster Bubble ( also called the Westminster village ) is a characterization of members of the Parliament of the United Kingdom as being isolated from life outside Parliament . 

This includes Members of Parliament , Peers , lobbyists , researchers , secretaries , civil servants , lobby correspondents and leader writers for newspapers and is so named because Parliament is located in Westminster , London . 

A similar situation occurs in the United States , where the governmental culture in and around Washington DC is sometimes known as the Washington Bubble or more often Inside the Beltway . 

More recently , in Scotland , there has been a development of a " Holyrood bubble " , as the Scottish Parliament is in the Holyrood district of Edinburgh . 

A recent example of the characterization includes Peter Hain speaking in the House on 29 January 2004 : 

" All broadcasters , the whole coverage of politics , the Westminster bubble that we as politicians of the Government and Opposition occupy together with the Westminster lobby ; together we are all conducting politics in a way that is turning off voters , listeners , readers and watchers by the million . " 

In July the previous year he had described it in a newspaper article as : 

In November 2003 Conservative Party Leader Michael Howard indicated on the day of his appointment that he wished to be a " leader outside the Westminster Bubble . "
