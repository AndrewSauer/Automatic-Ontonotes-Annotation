The Lehigh Coal and Navigation Company ( LCAN ) ( 1988â€“2010 ) was a modern - day anthracite coal mining company headquartered in Pottsville , Schuylkill County , Pennsylvania , U.S. which acquired many of the ' Old Company ' ( LC&N ; ) properties and re - launched the Lehigh Coal Companies brand in 1988 . 

The LCAN ran strip mining operations in the Panther Creek Valley east of Lansford along U.S. Route 209 ; with vast properties dominating the coal areas of Tamaqua , Coaldale , and Lansford . 

These properties are largely the same real estate assets as were acquired in the Panther Creek Valley by the predecessors : the haphazard Lehigh Coal Mine Company ( 1792 - 1822 ) and the builders of the Lehigh Canal and first American blast furnaces , the Lehigh Coal & Navigation Company ( Old Company , LC&N ; ) , which spearheaded the U.S. Industrial revolution . 

The new company was incorporated in 1988 acquiring LC&N ; assets after bankruptcy proceedings , taking the name of the original .
