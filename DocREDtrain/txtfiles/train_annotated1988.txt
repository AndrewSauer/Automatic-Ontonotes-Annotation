Turkey shares its longest common border with Syria ; various geographic and historical links also tie the two neighboring countries together . 

The traditional tenseness in relations had been due to disputes including the self annexation of the Hatay Province to Turkey in 1939 , water disputes resulting from the Southeastern Anatolia Project , and Syria 's support for the Kurdistan Workers ' Party ( abbreviated as PKK ) and the now - dissolved Armenian Secret Army for the Liberation of Armenia ( abbreviated as ASALA ) which has been recognised as a terrorist organisation by NATO , EU , and many other countries . 

Relations improved greatly after October 1998 , when PKK leader Abdullah Öcalan was expelled by Syrian authorities . 

However , the Syrian civil war has once again strained relations between the two countries , leading to the suspension of diplomatic contact . 

A serious incident occurred with the Syrian downing of a Turkish military training flight in June 2012 , resulting in Turkey calling an emergency meeting of NATO . 

Syria had maintained an embassy in Ankara and two consulates – general in Istanbul and Gaziantep . 

Turkey had an embassy in Damascus and a consulate – general in Aleppo . 

Diplomatic relations between the countries were severed in March 2012 , due to the Syrian civil war . 

Turkey is a full member of the Union for the Mediterranean and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation ( OIC ) while Syria 's membership was suspended due to the civil war .
