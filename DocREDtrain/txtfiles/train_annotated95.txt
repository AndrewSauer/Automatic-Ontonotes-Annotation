Marie Madeleine Jodin ( 1741 â€“ 1790 ) was an eighteenth - century French actress , friend of Diderot , and early feminist . 

Jodin was born to a prostitute mother and a Swiss clockmaker father . 

After a childhood of forced imprisonment and religious conversion , she eventually became an actress performing in the Comedie Francaise in Paris and then in Warsaw , Dresden , and Bordeaux during the 1760s . 

When her father died she became the ward of his friend , the encyclopedist , and art critic Denis Diderot , who would became her mentor . 

Diderot 's help would shape the course of her adult acting life and many of her feminist theories that she would later present in her treatise Vues Legislative Pour Les Femmes to the French National Assembly . 

Her treatise is considered to be the first feminist work to be written and signed by a woman in the French Revolutionary period and Enlightenment periods .
