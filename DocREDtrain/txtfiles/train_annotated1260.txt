The Karangahake Gorge lies between the Coromandel and Kaimai ranges , at the southern end of the Coromandel Peninsula in New Zealand 's North Island . 

A sharply winding canyon , it was formed by the Ohinemuri River . 

State Highway 2 passes through this gorge between the towns of Paeroa , Waikino and Waihi . 

This road is the main link between the Waikato region and the Bay of Plenty . 

The East Coast Main Trunk Railway used to run through the gorge until it was bypassed by the Kaimai Deviation - and the Karangahake Gorge section is now a combined walkway and cycleway , part of the Hauraki Rail Trail . 

There are also several walks and tracks starting at the Karangahake Reserve car park and picnic area ; ranging from 30 minutes to over 2 hours .
