The Wattles Estate , originally known as Jualita , is a historic house and park in the Hollywood area of Los Angeles , California , United States . 

It was built in 1907 by wealthy Omaha , Nebraska , banker Gurdon Wattles as a winter home . 

Next to the Wattles Mansion are Wattles Park and Wattles Gardens , now administered by the City of Los Angeles and open to the public . 

The estate has been recognized as " the only remaining intact example of the once plentiful Hollywood estates from the period preceding the film industry , when Hollywood was primarily agricultural and was a wintering home for wealthy Easterners and Midwesterners . " 

According to the City of Los Angeles , " ' Jualita ' is one of the few remaining landscapes reminiscent of another era and tradition , possessing a genuine integrity of setting , design , workmanship , and association . "
