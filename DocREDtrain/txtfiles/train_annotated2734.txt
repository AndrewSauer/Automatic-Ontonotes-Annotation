The Primary Reserve of the Canadian Armed Forces ( ) is the first and largest of the four sub - components of the Canadian Forces reserves , followed by the Supplementary Reserve , the Canadian Rangers , and the Cadet Organizations Administration and Training Service ( formerly the Cadet Instructors Cadre ) .

The Primary Reserve consists of sailors , soldiers and airmen who train to the level of , and are interchangeable with , their Regular Force counterparts , as per the " total force " policy outlined in both the 1987 and 1994 Defence White Papers , and are posted to CF operations or duties on an ongoing basis . 

Each reserve force is operationally and administratively responsible to its corresponding environmental command ; those being the Royal Canadian Navy , the Canadian Army and the Royal Canadian Air Force . 

Primary reservists number approximately 27,000 ( all ranks , all services ) .
