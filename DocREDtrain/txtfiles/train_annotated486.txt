Metropolitan France ( or la Métropole ) , also known as European France or Mainland France , is the part of France in Europe . 

It comprises mainland France and nearby islands in the Atlantic Ocean , the English Channel ( ) , and the Mediterranean Sea , including Corsica . 

Overseas France ( la France d'outre - mer , or l'Outre - mer , or colloquially les DOM - TOM ) is the collective name for the part of France outside Europe : French overseas regions ( départements et régions d'outre - mer or DROM ) , territories ( territoires d'outre - mer or TOM ) , collectivities ( collectivités d'outre - mer or COM ) , and the sui generis collectivity ( collectivité sui generis ) of New Caledonia . 

Metropolitan France and Overseas France together form the French Republic . 

Metropolitan France accounts for 82.0 % of the land territory , 3.3 % of the exclusive economic zone ( EEZ ) , and 95.9 % of the population of the French Republic . 

The five overseas regions ( departments)—Martinique , Guadeloupe , Réunion , French Guiana , and Mayotte — have the same political status as metropolitan France 's regions . 

Metropolitan France and these five overseas regions together are sometimes called la France entière ( " the whole of France " ) by the French administration . 

But this France entière does not include the French overseas collectivities and territories that have more autonomy than do the overseas departments . 

In overseas France , a person from metropolitan France is often called a métro , short for métropolitain .
