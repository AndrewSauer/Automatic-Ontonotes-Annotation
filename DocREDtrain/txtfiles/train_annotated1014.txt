Marian " Clover " Hooper Adams ( September 13 , 1843 â€“ December 6 , 1885 ) was an American socialite , active society hostess , and arbiter of Washington , DC , and an accomplished amateur photographer . 

Clover , who has been cited as the inspiration for writer Henry James 's Daisy Miller ( 1878 ) and The Portrait of a Lady ( 1881 ) , was married to writer Henry Adams . 

After her suicide , he commissioned the famous Adams Memorial , which features an enigmatic androgynous bronze sculpture by Augustus Saint - Gaudens , to stand at the site of her , and his , grave . 

After Clover 's death , Adams destroyed all the letters that she had ever written to him and rarely , if ever , spoke of her in public . 

She was also omitted from his The Education of Henry Adams .
