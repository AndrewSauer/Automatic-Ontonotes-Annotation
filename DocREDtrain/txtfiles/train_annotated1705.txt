The Union Club Mysteries is a collection of mystery short stories by American author Isaac Asimov featuring his fictional mystery solver Griswold . 

It was first published in hardcover by Doubleday in 1983 and in paperback by the Fawcett Crest imprint of Ballantine Books in 1985 . 

The book collects thirty stories by Asimov , most reprinted from magazines and a few previously unpublished , together with a foreword and afterword by the author . 

Each story is set at a club known as the Union Club , in which a conversation between three members prompts a fourth member , Griswold , to tell about a mystery he has solved . 

These are often tall stories , and often based on his time in US intelligence . 

The format is based on that utilized by P. G. Wodehouse in recounting his golf stories . 

According to reviewer John H. Jenkins , these stories are not rated particularly well by Asimov fans , and are less well regarded than his better known Black Widowers mysteries . 

He does regard a few of them more highly , particularly " No Refuge Could Save " and " Hide and Seek , " but feels the brevity and format of the stories allows the author little scope . 

It is also open to question whether they are supposed to be serious mysteries or tall stories . 

Asimov wrote a total of 55 Union Club stories . 

As well as the 30 in this book , three more were collected in The Best Mysteries of Isaac Asimov ( Doubleday , 1986 ) . 

The other 22 have never been collected in any of Asimov 's books . 

One of these 22 , " Getting Even , " is also part of Asimov 's Azazel series of fantasy stories .
