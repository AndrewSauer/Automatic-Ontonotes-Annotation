Hansberry v. Lee , 311 U.S. 32 ( 1940 ) , is a famous case now usually known in civil procedure for teaching that res judicata may not bind a subsequent plaintiff who had no opportunity to be represented in the earlier civil action . 

The facts of the case dealt with a racially restrictive covenant that barred African Americans from purchasing or leasing land in the Washington Park Subdivision of Chicago 's Woodlawn neighborhood . 

The covenant had been upheld in a prior class action lawsuit , which had included Lee , along with all the other neighborhood landowners , as members of the class . 

The defense in the present case argued that Carl Augustus Hansberry ( father of Lorraine Hansberry ) could not contest the covenant because it had already been deemed valid by the courts in the prior lawsuit . 

The US Supreme Court disagreed and held that since some of the neighborhood landowners ( 46 % ) comprising the class of the prior lawsuit did not support the restrictive covenant , the previous decision that the covenant was valid could not apply to all members of that class . 

In other words , it was erroneous to allow the 54 % of neighborhood landowners who had supported the restrictive covenant to represent the interests of the 46 % who were against it . 

Therefore , the Supreme Court held that the restrictive covenant could be contested in court again , even though some of the parties involved may have been included in the prior class of neighborhood landowner . 

Later , the type of real property restriction , racially restrictive covenants , was held by Shelley v. Kraemer , , to be state action because the plaintiffs seeking to enforce such a covenant were invoking the machinery of the state .
