The Bern – Lötschberg – Simplon railway ( BLS ) , known between 1997 and 2006 as the BLS Lötschbergbahn , was a Swiss railway company . 

In 2006 the company merged with Regionalverkehr Mittelland AG to form a new company called BLS AG . 

The Bern – Lötschberg – Simplon railway was the largest standard gauge network on the Swiss Railway system apart from the Swiss Federal Railways . 

The railway had not been built at the time that the Federal government took control of the five big Swiss standard gauge railway companies in 1902 and so it led a separate existence , being considered the largest of the Swiss " private " railways , although the majority of its capital was owned by the cantonal government of Bern , with the Confederation holding about one fifth .
