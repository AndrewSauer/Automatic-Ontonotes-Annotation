Juw Juwinga ( alias Jongema ) of Bolsward was a Frisian chieftain that earned great fame in the struggle against the ( Dutch ) ‘ infidels’ . 

When Albrecht of Bavaria , count of Holland , threatened Friesland in 1396 , Juw was chosen as potestate of Friesland . 

He advised luring the enemy into the land . 

The Schieringers limited their defense to the coastline . 

The Dutch were defeated at Schoterzijl ( in Weststellingwerf ) where Juw was slain on August 29 , 1396 . 

Juw was also known as Julius Jongema , and Petrus Thaborita wrote his name as Ju Jonghema . 

The previous potestate was Hessel Martena . 

However the potestates were absent for many years due to arguments between Vetkopers and Schieringers and Juw was the eleventh potestaat .
