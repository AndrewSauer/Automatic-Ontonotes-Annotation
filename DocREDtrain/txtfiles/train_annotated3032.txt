In the Republic of Austria , the Constitutional Court ( or ) is the tribunal responsible for the judicial review of the constitutionality of statutes , the legality of ordinances and other secondary legislation , and the constitutionality of decisions of certain other courts . 

The Constitutional Court also decides demarcation conflicts between courts , between courts and the administration , and between the national government and the regional governments . 

It hears election complaints , holds elected officials and political appointees accountable for their conduct in office , and adjudicates on liability claims against Austria and its bureaucracy . 

The Constitutional Court consists of fourteen members and six substitute members , appointed by the president on nomination of the cabinet , the National Council , and the Federal Council . 

Although theoretically supposed to , the Court rarely meets in plenum and rarely hears oral arguments ; most cases today are decided behind closed doors by panels of either nine or five members . 

Opinions tend to be concise and academic . 

The Constitutional Court is very powerful but has historically exhibited considerable judicial restraint . 

As of February 2018 , Brigitte Bierlein is serving as the court 's president , and Christoph Grabenwarter as its vice president .
