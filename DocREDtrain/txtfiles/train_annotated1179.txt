" Exile " is the thirty - second episode of the twenty - ninth series of the British medical drama Casualty . 

It was written by Kelly Jones , directed by Steve Hughes , and produced by Jonathan Phillips . 

" Exile " first aired on 16 May 2015 on BBC One in the United Kingdom . 

The plot sees Charlie Fairhead ( Derek Thompson ) and Connie Beauchamp ( Amanda Mealing ) travel to Bucharest to help Charlie 's son Louis ( Gregory Foreman ) , who has become a heroin addict and is planning on selling his kidney to pay his debts . 

Executive producer Oliver Kent initially had doubts about taking the show away from its regular setting , as he thought it might appear " odd " . 

Unlike other episodes , " Exile " only follows one story , as opposed to multiple plots . 

Producers decided that Louis would be central to the story , as putting him in jeopardy meant Charlie had to come to his rescue . 

The producers also wanted to send Charlie and Connie on a metaphorical rollercoaster , before reaching pivotal points in their story arcs . 

Kent hoped " Exile " would become " a talking point " among viewers in the future . 

The episode was filmed on - location in Romania in late 2014 , marking the first time an entire episode of Casualty has been filmed abroad . 

Scenes from the episode were first seen in an April 2015 trailer for the show , while two 30-second trailers were released shortly ahead of its broadcast . 

" Exile " was seen by 5.28 million viewers , making it the 12th most watched programme on BBC One for the week ending 17 May 2015 . 

It received positive reviews from critics , with Alison Graham of Radio Times calling it " a positive thing for the characters " and Sarah Ellis of Inside Soap branding the plot " a heart - wrenching story " .
