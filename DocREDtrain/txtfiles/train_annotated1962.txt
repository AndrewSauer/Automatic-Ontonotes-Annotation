Gogo ( died 581 ) was the mayor of the palace of Austrasia and nutricius ( also nutritius , tutor / regent ) for the young Childebert II from 576 until his death . 

Gogo had become a very prominent member of the court of Sigebert I by 565 . 

It was he who headed an embassy to Spain to fetch the Visigothic princess Brunhilda , Sigebert 's betrothed . 

When Sigebert was assassinated he , possibly at the request of Brunhilda , took over the regency for Sigebert and Brunhilda 's son Childebert . 

There is a letter , an important but difficult source , written by Gogo , but undated and unattached to the name of either king he served . 

It has traditionally been assigned to around the year of his death ( 581 ) and said to have been written on behalf of Childebert to the Lombard Duke of Friuli , Grasulf . 

An alternative solution put forward by Walter Goffart places it as early as 571 â€“ 572 around the time of Sigebert 's embassy to Constantinople .
