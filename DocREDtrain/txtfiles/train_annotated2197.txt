The Imam Bukhari Jamaat ( , also Katibat Imam al Bukhari ) is an Islamist Salafi group fighting in the Syrian Civil War and the War in Afghanistan , composed of primarily Uzbeks , and expressing loyalty to the Taliban movement . 

The group originally operated only in Syria , where it is allied with other jihadist organisations such as al - Nusra Front and Ahrar ash - Sham , and alongside these other groups it makes up the Army of Conquest , which overran much of Idlib province in north Syria in 2015 . 

Since late 2016 , the group has also began to fight against Afghan National Security Forces , and has claimed to have set up training camps in northern Afghanistan . 

The group is named after Imam Bukhari , a 9th - century Islamic scholar who was from Bukhara in modern - day Uzbekistan .
