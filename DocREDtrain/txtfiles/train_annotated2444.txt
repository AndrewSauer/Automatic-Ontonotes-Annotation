Mary Catherine Crawford ( born 12 April 1947 ) was an Australian politician . 

Born in Toowoomba , Queensland , she was educated at the University of Queensland before becoming a teacher . 

In 1987 , she was elected to the Australian House of Representatives as the Labor member for Forde . 

On 25 March 1994 she was appointed Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Housing and Regional Development , a position she held until the defeat of the Keating Government in the 1996 election , in which Crawford lost her seat . 

Crawford had previously held her seat with a fairly safe majority of 8.6 percent . 

However , a redistribution ahead of the election pushed Forde into some rural , conservative - leaning territory in the Scenic Rim . 

This wiped out Crawford 's majority , reducing it to an extremely marginal 0.1 percent . 

Believing that this made Forde difficult — if not impossible — to hold , Crawford tried to transfer to the friendlier seat of Rankin , but was rebuffed by the party 's organisational wing . 

She was defeated by Liberal Kay Elson on a nine - percent swing .
