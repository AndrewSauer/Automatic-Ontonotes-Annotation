This is a list of European basketball players who have played in the United States at either professional or NCAA Division I level . 

It is intended to include players who are currently active , whether inside or outside the U.S. , and former players ( both living and deceased ) . 

For the purpose of this article , a " European player in the United States " is defined as a citizen of a FIBA Europe member country who was playing in the U.S. while a citizen of said country . 

Examples of players who do not fall within this definition are : 

Howard Carter , who became a naturalized citizen of France after having played professionally in that country , and never played in the U.S. while a French citizen . 

Jeff Taylor , whose story is similar to that or Carter , except that his eventual country of citizenship was Sweden . 

However , his son Jeffery , born in Sweden as a dual citizen of both the U.S. and Sweden , is listed . 

Kelenna Azubuike , who despite being born and raised in the United Kingdom has never held British citizenship . 

He was born a Nigerian citizen . 

In addition , NBA players are considered to be playing in the United States even if they have played only for a Canada - based team ( currently the Toronto Raptors , and in the past the Vancouver Grizzlies and Toronto Huskies ) . 

If a player is listed as being a dual citizen , his or her country of birth is indicated first .
