Captain Gurbachan Singh Salaria , PVC ( 29 November 1935 â€“ 5 December 1961 ) was an Indian Army officer and member of a United Nations peacekeeping force . 

He is the only UN peacekeeper to receive the Param Vir Chakra ( PVC ) , India 's highest wartime military decoration . 

Singh was an alumnus of King George 's Royal Military College and the National Defence Academy . 

He was the first NDA alumnus and only UN Peacekeeper to be awarded a PVC . 

In December 1961 , Salaria was among the Indian troops deployed to the Republic of the Congo as part of the United Nations Operation in the Congo . 

On 5 December , Salaria 's battalion was tasked to clear a roadblock of two armoured cars manned by 150 gendarmes of the secessionist State of Katanga on the way to the Elizabethville Airport . 

The plan was that Salaria and his men were to block their retreat . 

His rocket launcher team attacked and destroyed the Katangese armoured cars . 

This unforeseen move confused the gendarmerie , and Salaria felt it would be best to attack before they reorganised . 

Though his troops were badly outnumbered , they charged towards the Katangese and killed 40 men in a kukri assault . 

During the attack , Salaria was shot twice in the neck and eventually succumbed to his injuries . 

The remaining gendarmes fled in utter confusion leaving their dead and wounded behind . 

This helped the main battalion to easily overrun the Katangese and clear the roadblock . 

For his duty and courage , and disregard for his own safety during the battle , Salaria was awarded the Param Vir Chakra .
