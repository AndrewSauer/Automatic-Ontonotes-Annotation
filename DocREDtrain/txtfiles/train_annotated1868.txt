George Harrison Shull ( April 15 , 1874 – September 28 , 1954 ) was an eminent American plant geneticist and the younger brother of botanical illustrator and plant breeder J. Marion Shull . 

He was born on a farm in Clark County , Ohio , graduated from Antioch College in 1901 and from the University of Chicago ( Ph.D. ) in 1904 , served as botanical expert to the Bureau of Plant Industry in 1903 - 04 , and thenceforth was a botanical investigator of the Carnegie Institution at the Station for Experimental Evolution , Cold Spring Harbor , N. Y. , giving special attention to the results of Luther Burbank 's work . 

Shull played an important role in the development of hybrid maize ( in the USA , popularly ' corn ' ) which had great impact upon global agriculture . 

As a geneticist , Shull worked with maize plants . 

He was interested in pure breeds not for their economic value but for his experiments in genetics . 

He produced maize breeds that bred true and then crossed these strains . 

The hybrid offspring of the sickly pure breeds were vigorous and predictable . 

In short , an ideal economic maize resulted from a project motivated purely to advance science . 

For his work on maize , Shull was awarded the Public Welfare Medal from the National Academy of Sciences in 1948 . 

He also described heterosis in maize in 1908 ( the term heterosis was coined by Shull in 1914 ) and made a number of other key discoveries in the emerging field of genetics . 

Shull was the founder of the scientific journal Genetics . 

He was called George in distinction from his son Harrison Shull ( 1923–2003 ) , also a distinguished scientist , specializing in the quantum mechanics of small - molecule electronic spectra .
