Many East Asian scripts can be written horizontally or vertically . 

Chinese , Japanese and Korean scripts can be oriented in either direction , as they consist mainly of disconnected logographic or syllabic units , each occupying a square block of space , thus allowing for flexibility for which direction texts can be written , be it horizontally from left - to - right , horizontally from right - to - left , vertically from top - to - bottom , and even vertically from bottom - to - top . 

Horizontal writing is known in Chinese as hengpai ( ) , in Japanese as yokogaki ( , " horizontal writing " , also yokogumi , ) , and in Korean as garosseugi ( ) or hoengseo (; ) . 

Vertical writing is known respectively as zongpai ( ) , tategaki ( , " vertical writing " , also tategumi , ) , or serosseugi ( ) or jongseo (; ) . 

Traditionally , Chinese , Japanese , and Korean are written vertically in columns going from top to bottom and ordered from right to left , with each new column starting to the left of the preceding one . 

The stroke order and stroke direction of Chinese characters ( hanzi in Chinese , kanji in Japanese , hanja in Korean ) , Japanese kana , and Korean Hangul all facilitate writing in this manner . 

In addition , writing in vertical columns from right to left facilitated writing with a brush in the right hand while continually unrolling the sheet of paper or scroll with the left . 

Since the nineteenth century , it has become increasingly common for these languages to be written horizontally , from left to right , with successive rows going from top to bottom , under the influence of European languages such as English , although vertical writing is still frequently used in Hong Kong , Japan , Macau , Korea , and Taiwan .
