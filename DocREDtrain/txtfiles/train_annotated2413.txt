The Grand Magazine was the first British pulp magazine . 

It was published monthly between February 1905 and April 1940 . 

Published by George Newnes , it initially emulated Newnes 's highly successful Strand Magazine , featuring a mix of fiction and non - fiction . 

In 1908 , it was renamed The Grand Magazine of Fiction . 

The New York Times greeted the appearance of the new magazine with the comment that " this is a promising periodical , containing much that will commend itself to the decent popular taste " , and added that " Mr Herbert Greenhough Smith , who has been the editor of The Strand Magazine , occupies the same post on the new periodical " . 

Although Herbert Greenhough Smith was associated with the launch of the magazine , the first editor , until 1910 , was Alderson Anderson . 

The many authors whose work appeared in The Grand included Agatha Christie , E. Phillips Oppenheim , Baroness Orczy , Rafael Sabatini , Edgar Wallace and P. G. Wodehouse .
