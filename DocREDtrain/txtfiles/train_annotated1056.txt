Paul Raphaelson ( born 1968 , New York , New York , USA ) , is an American artist best known for urban landscape photography . 

In the early 1990s , after moving to Providence , Rhode Island , he started producing formally complex , often dark depictions of the urban , suburban , and industrial landscape . 

This work , which grew into the project titled " Wilderness " continued to evolve when Raphaelson moved to Brooklyn , New York in 1995 . 

The work went unnoticed by the larger photography art world until it was discovered by Sandra Phillips of the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art . 

It later caught the attention of former Museum of Modern Art curator John Szarkowski , who acquired prints on behalf of private collections . 

Raphaelson began working in color in 2005 , continuing to explore urban spaces bordering the occupied and abandoned , and the residential and industrial . 

In 2012 he brought a hand camera into the New York City subway , photographing passengers through the reflections , obfuscations , and framing of the train windows . 

In 2013 he was the last photographer granted permission to photograph the Domino Sugar Refinery in Williamsburg , Brooklyn , before its 2014 demolition and redevelopment . 

He expanded the project beyond ruin photographs , to encompass document , industrial history , and a philosophical exploration of the significance of ruin art in post - industrial popular culture . 

This project culminated in the 2017 book , Brooklyn 's Sweet Ruin : Relics and Stories of the Domino Sugar Refinery . 

Raphaelson 's grandfather was the playwright and screenwriter Samson Raphaelson , who practiced photography as an amateur in the 1950s and early 1960s . 

Raphaelson 's ongoing projects include experiments with images and text , and photographic noise .
