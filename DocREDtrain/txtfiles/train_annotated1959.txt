Humphrey the Bear is a cartoon character created by the Walt Disney studio in 1950 . 

He first appeared in the Goofy cartoon Hold That Pose , in which Goofy tried to take his picture . 

After that he appeared in four classic Donald Duck cartoons : Rugged Bear , Grin and Bear It , Bearly Asleep , and Beezy Bear . 

Disney gave him his own series in 1955 , but only two films resulted ( Hooked Bear and In the Bag ) before Disney discontinued making theatrical short subjects . 

When the shorts division closed , Humphrey was the last of only seven Disney characters who had been given a series of their own , starring in cartoons who opened with their own logo ( the six others were Mickey Mouse , Donald Duck , Goofy , Pluto , Chip ' n ' Dale ( counting as one ) , and Figaro ) . 

The Humphrey cartoons have been aptly described by Leonard Maltin as " belly - laugh " shorts , and they feature a broader , wilder style of comedy than the usually cute or coy Disney gags .
