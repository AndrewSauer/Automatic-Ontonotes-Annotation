Fort Mississauga National Historic Site is a fort on the shore of Lake Ontario , at the mouth of the Niagara River in Niagara - on - the - Lake , Ontario , Canada . 

The fort today consists of a box – shaped brick tower and historic star – shaped earthworks . 

The all – brick fort was built from 1814 – 1816 during the War of 1812 , to replace nearby Fort George . 

It was built on a foundation of brick and stone salvaged from rubble left after retreating United States forces burned the nearby town of Niagara ( as Niagara - on - the - Lake was known then ) in December , 1813 . 

It would help in the defence of Upper Canada the following year , as part of a regional network that included Fort George , Navy Hall , and Butler 's Barracks . 

However , the fort would n't be completed until after the war .
