The Warped Tour was a traveling rock tour that had toured the United States ( including 3 or 4 stops in Canada ) annually each summer from 1995 to 2018 . 

It was the largest traveling music festival in the United States , and was the longest - running touring music festival in North America . 

The first Warped Tour took place in 1995 , and the skateboard shoe manufacturer Vans became the main sponsor of the tour starting with the second tour in 1996 , when it became known as the Vans Warped Tour . 

Although Vans continued to be the main sponsor and lended its name to the festival , other sponsors also participated with stages or other aspects of the festival sometimes being named after them . 

Warped Tour was conceived in 1995 as an eclectic alternative rock festival , but in 1996 began focusing on punk rock music . 

Although it has continued to be known primarily as a punk rock festival , it has included acts of diverse genres over the years . 

Warped Tour founder Kevin Lyman stated that the 2018 Vans Warped Tour would be the final , full cross - country run . 

Lyman did hint at a large celebration in 2019 ; the 25th year of the tour .
