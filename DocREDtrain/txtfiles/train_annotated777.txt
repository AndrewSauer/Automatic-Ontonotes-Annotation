Johannes de Sacrobosco , also written Ioannis de Sacro Bosco ( 1195 â€“ 1256 ) , was a scholar , monk and astronomer who was a teacher at the University of Paris . 

He wrote a short introduction to the Hindu - Arabic numeral system which became the most widely read introduction to that subject in the later medieval centuries ( judging from the number of manuscript copies that survive today ) . 

He also wrote a short astronomy textbook , Tractatus de Sphaera , which was widely read and influential in Europe during the later medieval centuries as an introduction to astronomy . 

In his longest and most original book , Sacrobosco correctly described the defects of the then - used Julian calendar , and , three centuries before its implementation , recommended a solution much like the modern Gregorian calendar . 

Very little is known about the education and biography of Sacrobosco . 

For one thing , his year of death has been guessed at 1236 , 1244 , and 1256 , each of which is plausible and each lacking adequate evidence .
