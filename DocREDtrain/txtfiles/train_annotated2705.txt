The Snowy Mountains scheme or Snowy scheme is a hydroelectricity and irrigation complex in south - east Australia . 

The Scheme consists of sixteen major dams ; seven power stations ; one pumping station ; and of tunnels , pipelines and aqueducts that were constructed between 1949 and 1974 . 

The Scheme was completed under the supervision of Chief Engineer , Sir William Hudson and is the largest engineering project undertaken in Australia . 

The water of the Snowy River and some of its tributaries , much of which formerly flowed southeast onto the river flats of East Gippsland , and into Bass Strait of the Tasman sea , is captured at high elevations and diverted inland to the Murray and Murrumbidgee Rivers irrigation areas , through two major tunnel systems driven through the Continental Divide of the Snowy Mountains , known in Australia as the Great Dividing Range . 

The water falls and travels through large hydro - electric power stations which generate peak - load power for the Australian Capital Territory , New South Wales and Victoria . 

In 2016 , the Snowy Mountains Scheme was added to the Australian National Heritage List .
