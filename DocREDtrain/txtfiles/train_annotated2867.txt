Grand Bank , Newfoundland and Labrador , Canada or ' Grand Banc ' as the first French settlers pronounced it , is a small rural town with a population of 2,580 . 

It is located on the southern tip or " toe " of the Burin Peninsula ( also known as " the boot " ) , 360 Â  km from the province 's capital of St. John 's . 

Grand Banc was inhabited by French fisherman as early as 1640 and started as a fishing settlement with about seven families . 

It was given the name " Grand Banc " because of the high bank that extends from Admiral 's Cove to the water 's edge on the west side of the harbour . 

The Town of Grand Bank can attribute much of its past and present growth and prosperity to its proximity to the fishing grounds and its ice - free harbour . 

Original settlers thrived on trade with the French and a vigorous inshore fishing industry . 

Grand Bank became the nucleus of the bank fishing industry for Newfoundland and a service centre for Fortune Bay . 

With the decline of the salt fish industry , the town 's emphasis quickly shifted to fresh fish production . 

Enterprising businessmen and town planners prepared the way for a fresh fish plant ( present day Grand Bank Seafoods Inc. ) and a fleet of trawlers .
