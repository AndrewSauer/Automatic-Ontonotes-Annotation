The history of the colonial period of South Carolina focuses on the English colonization that created one of the original Thirteen Colonies . 

Major settlement began after 1651 as the northern half of the British colony of Carolina attracted frontiersmen from Pennsylvania and Virginia , while the southern parts were populated by wealthy English people who set up large plantations dependent on slave labor , for the cultivation of cotton , rice , and indigo . 

The colony was separated into the Province of South Carolina and the Province of North Carolina in 1712 . 

South Carolina 's capital city of Charleston became a major port for traffic on the Atlantic Ocean , and South Carolina developed indigo , rice and Sea Island cotton as commodity crop exports , making it one of the most prosperous of the colonies . 

A strong colonial government fought wars with the local Indians , and with Spanish imperial outposts in Florida , while fending off the threat of pirates . 

Birth rates were high , food was abundant , and these offset the disease environment of malaria to produce rapid population growth among whites . 

With the expansion of plantation agriculture , the colony imported numerous African slaves , who comprised a majority of the population by 1708 . 

They were integral to its development . 

The colony developed a system of laws and self - government and a growing commitment to Republicanism , which patriots feared was threatened by the British Empire after 1765 . 

At the same time , men with close commercial and political ties to Great Britain tended to be Loyalists when the revolution broke out . 

South Carolina joined the American Revolution in 1775 , but was bitterly divided between Patriots and Loyalists . 

The British invaded in 1780 and captured most of the state , but were finally driven out .
