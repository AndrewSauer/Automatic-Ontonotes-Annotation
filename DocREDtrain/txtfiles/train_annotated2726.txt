Michael Morris Rosbash ( born March 7 , 1944 ) is an American geneticist and chronobiologist . 

Rosbash is a professor at Brandeis University and investigator at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute . 

Rosbash 's research group cloned the Drosophila period gene in 1984 and proposed the Transcription Translation Negative Feedback Loop for circadian clocks in 1990 . 

In 1998 , they discovered the cycle gene , clock gene , and cryptochrome photoreceptor in Drosophila through the use of forward genetics , by first identifying the phenotype of a mutant and then determining the genetics behind the mutation . 

Rosbash was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 2003 . 

Along with Michael W. Young and Jeffrey C. Hall , he was awarded the 2017 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine " for their discoveries of molecular mechanisms controlling the circadian rhythm " .
