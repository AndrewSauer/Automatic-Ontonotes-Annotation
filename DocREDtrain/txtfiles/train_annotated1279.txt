The Gospel of John ( , to kata Ioánnin euangelion ) , is the fourth of the canonical gospels . 

The work is anonymous , although it identifies an unnamed " disciple whom Jesus loved " as the source of its traditions . 

It is closely related in style and content to the three Johannine epistles , and most scholars treat the four books , along with the Book of Revelation , as a single corpus of Johannine literature , albeit not from the same author . 

C. K. Barrett , and later Raymond E. Brown , suggested that a tradition developed around the " Johannine Community " , and that this tradition gave rise to the gospel . 

The discovery of a large number of papyrus fragments of manuscripts with Johannine themes has led more scholars to recognize that the texts were among the most influential in the early Church . 

The discourses contained in this gospel seem to be concerned with issues of the church – synagogue debate at the time of composition . 

It is notable that in John , the community appears to define itself primarily in contrast to Judaism , rather than as part of a wider Christian community . 

Though Christianity started as a movement within Judaism , it gradually separated from Judaism because of mutual opposition between the two religions .
