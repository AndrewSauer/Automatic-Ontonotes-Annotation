Camilo Jos√© Vergara ( born 1944 in Santiago , Chile ) is a Chilean - born , New York - based writer , photographer and documentarian . 

Vergara has been compared to Jacob Riis for his photographic documentation of American slums and decaying urban environments . 

Beginning in the 1980s , Vergara applied the technique of rephotography to a series of American cities , photographing the same buildings and neighborhoods from the exact vantage point at regular intervals over many years to capture changes over time . 

Trained as a sociologist with a specialty in urbanism , Vergara turned to his systematic documentation at a moment of urban decay , and he chose locales where that stress seemed highest : the housing projects of Chicago ; the South Bronx of New York City ; Camden , New Jersey ; and Detroit , Michigan , among others .
