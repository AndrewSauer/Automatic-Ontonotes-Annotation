Letters from the Earth is a posthumously published work of celebrated American author Mark Twain ( 1835 – 1910 ) collated by Bernard DeVoto . 

It comprises essays written during a difficult time in Twain 's life ( 1904 – 09 ) , when he was deeply in debt and had recently lost his wife and one of his daughters . 

The content concerns morality and religion and strikes a sarcastic — Twain 's own term throughout the book — tone . 

Initially , another of his daughters , Clara Clemens , objected to its publication in March 1939 , probably because of its controversial and iconoclastic views on religion , claiming it presented a " distorted " view of her father . 

Henry Nash Smith helped change her position in 1960 . 

Clara explained her change of heart in 1962 saying that " Mark Twain belonged to the world " and that public opinion had become more tolerant . 

She was also influenced to release the papers by her annoyance with Soviet reports that her father 's ideas were being suppressed in the United States . 

The papers were selected , edited and sequenced for the book in 1939 by Bernard DeVoto .
