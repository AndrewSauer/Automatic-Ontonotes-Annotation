Governments around the world have passed measures to phase out incandescent light bulbs for general lighting in favor of more energy - efficient lighting alternatives . 

Phase - out regulations effectively ban the manufacture , importation or sale of incandescent light bulbs for general lighting . 

The regulations would allow sale of future versions of incandescent bulbs if they are sufficiently energy efficient . 

Brazil and Venezuela started the phase - out in 2005 , and the European Union , Switzerland , and Australia started to phase them out in 2009 . 

Likewise , other nations are implementing new energy standards or have scheduled phase - outs : Argentina , and Russia in 2012 , and the United States , Canada , Mexico , Malaysia and South Korea in 2014 . 

Objections to replacement of incandescent lamps for general lighting mainly include the higher purchasing cost of alternative light bulbs . 

To mitigate the effects of these concerns , various programs have been put in place ranging from subsidies for lamps to improved standards for measurement of performance and for labelling products . 

Manufacturers develop fluorescent lamps with reduced mercury content compared to original designs , and recycling programs are intended to prevent mercury release . 

New lamp types offer improved starting characteristics , and dimmable types are available .
