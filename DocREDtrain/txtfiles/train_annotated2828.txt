A United Nations Security Council resolution is a UN resolution adopted by the fifteen members of the Security Council ; the UN body charged with " primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security " . 

The UN Charter specifies ( in Article 27 ) that a draft resolution on non - procedural matters is adopted if nine or more of the fifteen Council members vote for the resolution , and if it is not vetoed by any of the five permanent members . 

Draft resolutions on " procedural matters " can be adopted on the basis of an affirmative vote by any nine Council members . 

The five permanent members are the People 's Republic of China ( which replaced the Republic of China in 1971 ) , France , Russia ( which replaced the defunct Soviet Union in 1991 ) , the United Kingdom , and the United States .
