The Petschek Palace ( in Czech Petschkův palác or Pečkárna ) is a neoclassicist building in Prague . 

It was built between 1923 and 1929 by the architect Max Spielmann upon a request from the merchant banker Julius Petschek and was originally called " The Bank House Petschek and Co. " ( Bankhaus Petschek & Co. ) Despite its historicizing look , the building was then a very modern one , being constructed of reinforced concrete and fully air - conditioned . 

It also had tube post , phone switch - board , printing office , a paternoster lift ( which is still functioning ) , and massive safes in the sublevel floor . 

The building was sold by the Petschek family before the occupation of Czechoslovakia , and the family left the country . 

It was during the war years that the place gained its notoriety , as it immediately became the headquarters of Gestapo for the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia . 

It was here where the interrogations and torturing of the Czech resistance members took place , as well as the courts - martial established by Reinhard Heydrich which sent most of the prisoners to death or to Nazi concentration camps . 

Many people were put to death in the building itself . 

A Blue plaque that commemorates the spirit of these war heroes was unveiled on the corner of the building . 

In 1948 the building was acquired by the then - Czechoslovak Ministry of Foreign Trade . 

Today it is the residence of a part of the Czech Ministry of Industry and Trade . 

In 1989 the building became a National Cultural Monument ( Národní kulturní památka ) .
