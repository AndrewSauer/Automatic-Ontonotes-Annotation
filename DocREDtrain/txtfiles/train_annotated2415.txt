Sima Shi ( ) ( 208 – March 255 ) , courtesy name Ziyuan , was a military general and regent of Cao Wei during the Three Kingdoms period of China . 

In 249 , he assisted his father Sima Yi in overthrowing the emperor Cao Fang 's regent Cao Shuang , allowing the Sima family to become paramount authority in the state , and he inherited his father 's authority after his father 's death in 251 . 

He maintained a tight grip on the political scene and , when the emperor Cao Fang considered action against him in 254 , he had Cao Fang deposed and replaced with his cousin Cao Mao . 

This tight grip eventually allowed him to , at the time of his death in 255 , transition his power to his younger brother Sima Zhao , whose son Sima Yan eventually usurped the throne and established the Jin dynasty . 

After Sima Yan became emperor , he , recognising Sima Shi 's role in his own imperial status , posthumously honoured his uncle as Emperor Jing ( 景帝 ) , with the temple name Shizong ( 世宗 ) .
