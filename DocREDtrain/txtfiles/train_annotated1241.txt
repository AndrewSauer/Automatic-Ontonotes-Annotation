Milo II of Montlhéry ( died 1118 ) was lord of Bray and Montlhéry , and viscount of Troyes . 

He was the son of Milo I the Great and Lithuise , and younger brother of Guy III of Montlhéry . 

He initially held the lordship of Bray - sur - Seine , in Champagne . 

In 1105 , he attacked his brother 's castle of Montlhéry , where his cousin Lucienne de Rochefort , fiancée of Louis VI of France , lived . 

He invested the castle , but could not succeed in capturing the donjon . 

Louis VI soon arrived to relieve the siege , and Milo was obliged to retire . 

On the death of his brother , both he and his cousin Hugh of Crecy asserted their rights to the lordship . 

Louis VI allotted it to Milo , who in 1113 revolted against him with Thibaut IV of Blois . 

He married Adela of Blois , daughter of the crusader Stephen , Count of Blois and his widowed countess , Adela of Normandy . 

This marriage was the result of a treaty negotiated by countess Adela . 

Milo was to support Adela against King Louis , and in return , he would marry Adela . 

Due to this connection , Milo was made viscount of Troyes . 

However , they divorced in 1115 . 

In 1118 Hugh of Crecy took revenge for his loss of Montlhéry by having Milo assassinated ; Louis VI then made Montlhéry part of the royal domain of France .
