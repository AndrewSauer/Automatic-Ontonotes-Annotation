Pauline Kael (; June 19 , 1919   – September 3 , 2001 ) was an American film critic who wrote for The New Yorker magazine from 1968 to 1991 . 

Kael was known for her " witty , biting , highly opinionated and sharply focused " reviews , her opinions often contrary to those of her contemporaries . 

She was one of the most influential American film critics of her day . 

She left a lasting impression on many other prominent film critics . 

Roger Ebert argued in an obituary that Kael " had a more positive influence on the climate for film in America than any other single person over the last three decades " . 

The critic , he said , " had no theory , no rules , no guidelines , no objective standards . 

You could n't apply her ' approach ' to a film . 

With her it was all personal " . 

Owen Gleiberman said she " was more than a great critic . 

She reinvented the form , and pioneered an entire aesthetic of writing " .
