The Doğu Çalışma Grubu ( DÇG ; ) was an alleged group within the Turkish military said to be linked to the Ergenekon organization , and possibly organised within the Turkish Gendarmerie 's JITEM . 

According to former PKK commander Şemdin Sakık , the group was formed in 1993 and carried out a number of assassinations in preparation for the 1993 alleged Turkish military coup . 

According to Sakık , these assassinations included ( in 1993 ) President Turgut Özal , former Major Cem Ersever , former Turkish Gendarmerie general commander Eşref Bitlis and General Bahtiyar Aydın . 

Turgut Özal died in office on 17 April 1993 in suspicious circumstances , and a month later the May 24 , 1993 PKK ambush took place , breaking the peace process which Özal had led . 

Sakık maintains the attack was part of the DÇG 's coup plans . 

Sakık also ascribes the death of Colonel Rıdvan Özden ( 1995 ) to the DÇG .
