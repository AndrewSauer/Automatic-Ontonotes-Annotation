Wandering As Water is Chris Brokaw 's second solo album , the follow - up to 2002 's Red Cities . 

Recorded by Paul Q. Kolderie on February 24 , 2003 at Camp Street , Cambridge , Massachusetts , Wandering As Water was released in mid-2003 by Return To Sender Records in Germany . 

The album was released in a digipak limited edition of 2,000 copies . 

Reviewing Wandering As Water , Pitchfork called it " [ o]ne of the most overlooked gems of the past year [ 2003 ] " , going on to assert that Brokaw 's " acuity with control and complexity creates a subtle , unspoken poetry . " 

Allmusic stated that although " [ t]he acoustic set - up works very well for Brokaw 's worn voice , [ ... ] some songs he chose actually suffer from being fleshed out . " 

" Shoot Me First " , " Recidivist " , and " German Song " were written and first recorded by Brokaw 's previous band , Come , whilst " Embryonic Journey " was composed by Jorma Kaukonen and originally performed by Jefferson Airplane . 

" Ba - Di - Da " was written by American folk singer - songwriter Fred Neil .
