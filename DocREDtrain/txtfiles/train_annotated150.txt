" Pilot " is the pilot episode of the American legal comedy - drama Suits , which premiered on USA Network in the United States on June 23 , 2011 . 

The episode was written by series creator Aaron Korsh and was directed by Kevin Bray . 

The series revolves around two lawyers who , between the two of them , have only one law degree . 

Harvey Specter ( Gabriel Macht ) is promoted to senior partner of the Pearson Hardman law firm . 

To his annoyance , company policy requires he hire a Harvard Law School graduate as his associate attorney . 

Meanwhile , college dropout Mike Ross ( Patrick J. Adams ) delivers a suitcase of marijuana for a friend , only to find that the drop is a sting operation . 

While escaping the police , he mistakenly sits for an interview with Harvey and impresses the attorney with his eidetic memory , encyclopedic knowledge of law , and drive to become a good lawyer . 

Despite Mike 's lack of a law degree , Harvey hires him . 

On Mike 's first day , Harvey must personally handle a pro bono case to keep his promotion . 

Instead , he has Mike take care of the suit , in which a woman claims her boss sexually harassed her . 

The series was originally written as a spec script for a half - hour drama set on Wall Street . 

Korsh later decided to change the premise because , unlike working on Wall Street , working as a lawyer requires several qualifications . 

The episode was watched by an estimated 4.64 million viewers and saw a double - digit growth over the January premiere of the network 's other legal drama Fairly Legal . 

However , critical reception was mixed . 

Some reviewers described the premise as absurd and preposterous and criticized the characters , most notably Harvey . 

Conversely , others lauded the characters ' interactions and the snappy dialogue and praised the series ' attempt to make the typical USA formula more grounded and edgy .
