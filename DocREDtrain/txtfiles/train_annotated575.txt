The New Zealand Rally Championship ( NZRC ) is New Zealand 's leading off - road motor rally competition . 

A multi - event national championship has been held each year since 1975 . 

Today the championship is held for a variety of classes based on engine capacity and further split by four or two wheel drive . 

The top class for a number of years has been the international Group N technical regulations and has been dominated by drivers of turbo - charged four wheel drive Mitsubishi Lancers and Subaru Imprezas . 

The New Zealand Rally Championship has been a launching pad for the career of many New Zealand drivers . 

Rod Millen and Possum Bourne being the most notable . 

Recently Hayden Paddon has used the series as a springboard to international competition , competing in the Asia - Pacific Rally Championship before moving on to the Production and Super 2000 World Rally Championships . 

The championship was formed around the then newly created Rally New Zealand when it joined the World Rally Championship in 1977 . 

Since then Rally New Zealand has frequently been the starring event of the NZRC and the event is current based in Auckland . 

The International Rally of Whangarei is also a round of the NZRC as well as being a round of the Asia - Pacific Rally Championship . 

The current six round championship also takes in events based in Otago and Canterbury regions with two events based at Wairarapa .
