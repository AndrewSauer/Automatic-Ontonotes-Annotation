Yorkdale Bus Terminal is located at 1 Yorkdale Road , Toronto , Ontario , Canada . 

It occupies the lowest level of an office building adjacent to Yorkdale Shopping Centre and is connected directly to Yorkdale subway station by a pedestrian bridge . 

Its creation was announced by James Snow , the Ontario Minister of Transportation and Communications , in March 1977 . 

Construction of the station started soon after , and was expected to be completed by late 1977 . 

The bus terminal is strategically located , in the middle of what was formerly the City of North York , at Allen Road on the south side of Highway 401 , the main transportation artery across the Greater Toronto Area . 

This is ideal for providing GO Transit commuter bus services to points east and west of the city and long - distance intercity coach connections by Ontario Northland and Greyhound . 

When it opened on October 12 , 1979 , it was a hub for Gray Coach interurban bus service and , until 2000 , for the Toronto Airport Express bus service originally operated by Gray Coach and , after 1993 , by Pacific Western Transportation . 

Because of the office building directly above the terminal , there is a severe height restriction within the terminal , and this prevents GO Transit from operating their current fleet of double - decker buses into the terminal .
