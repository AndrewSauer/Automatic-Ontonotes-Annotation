Samuel Musgrave , FRS ( 29 September 1732 â€“ 5 July 1780 ) was an English classical scholar and physician . 

Musgrave was born at Washfield in Devon , and was educated at the University of Oxford . 

There he was elected to a Radcliffe travelling fellowship , and he spent several years abroad . 

In 1766 he settled at Exeter , but moved to Plymouth to improve his career prospects . 

Everything went wrong when he published a pamphlet in the form of an address to the people of Devon , accusing certain members of the British government of having been bribed by the French government to conclude the Treaty of Paris ( 1763 ) , and declaring that Chevalier Charles d'Eon de Beaumont , the French minister plenipotentiary to England , had in his possession documents which would prove the truth of his assertion . 

Eon de Beaumont denied all knowledge of any such transaction and of Musgrave himself , and the House of Commons in 1770 decided that the charge was unsubstantiated . 

The discredited Musgrave was obliged to earn a meagre living in London by writing until his death , in reduced circumstances . 

He wrote several medical works , now forgotten ; and his edition of Euripides ( 1778 ) was a considerable advance on that of Joshua Barnes .
