The first inauguration of Ulysses S. Grant as the 18th President of the United States took place on March 4 , 1869 . 

The inauguration marked the commencement of the first four - year term of Ulysses S. Grant as President and the only term of Schuyler Colfax as Vice President . 

Chief Justice Salmon P. Chase administered the Oath of office . 

Andrew Johnson did not attend the inaugural ceremonies , as President - elect Grant refused to sit with him in the carriage going to it . 

Instead , he was in the White House signing last - minute legislation . 

Grant 's 1869 inaugural parade was grander than any of those before him . 

Eight full divisions of soldiers marched down Pennsylvania Avenue on that day . 

Windows overlooking the parade route sold for very high prices . 

This is also the first time ever that special tickets were required for admission to the Capitol on inauguration day . 

That evening , a ball was held in the Treasury Building .
