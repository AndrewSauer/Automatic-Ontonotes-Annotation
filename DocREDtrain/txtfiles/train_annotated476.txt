The Registan Desert ( Persian : ) , also known as Rigestan Desert , is an extremely arid plateau region located between Helmand and Kandahar provinces in southwestern Afghanistan . 

It is a sandy desert consisting of small , red sand hills about 50 to high , sand - covered plains , and open rocky and clay - covered areas . 

The underlying base of the hills consists of partly stabilized ancient transverse dunes , reflecting a west - to - east wind and nearly unlimited sand supply . 

The desert is very sparsely populated by Baluchi and Pashtun nomads . 

The desert is gradually encroaching on surrounding agricultural areas . 

A severe drought in 1998 caused the displacement of approximately 100,000 nomadic people from the Registan desert region . 

Most of them are now living in temporary settlements between the Arghandab and Helmand Rivers and Registan . 

A large number are also being supported by the UN in camps for internally displaced persons ( IDPs ) in Kandahar Province . 

The UN is currently seeking strategies to return the nomads to their traditional livelihood of raising livestock in Registan . 

The Registan Desert is migrating westward , encroaching on former agricultural areas . 

The United Nations Environment Programme team reports that " up to 100 villages have been submerged by windblown dust and sand " . 

In the country 's northwest , sand dunes are moving onto agricultural land , their path cleared by the loss of stabilizing vegetation from firewood gathering and overgrazing . 

The UNEP team observed sand dunes nearly 50 feet ( 15 meters ) high blocking roads , forcing residents to establish new routes .
