Washington , D.C. , during the American Civil War was the nerve - centre of the Union war effort , which rapidly turned it from a small city into a major capital with a full civic infrastructure and strong defences . 

The shock of Union defeat at First Bull Run , with demoralised troops wandering the streets of the capital , caused President Lincoln to order extensive fortifications and a large garrison . 

This required an influx of troops , military suppliers and building contractors , which would set up a new demand for accommodation , including military hospitals . 

The abolition of slavery in D.C. in 1862 also attracted many freedmen to the city . 

Except for one attempted invasion by Confederate cavalry leader Jubal Early in 1864 , the capital remained impregnable . 

When Lincoln was assassinated in Ford â€™s Theater in April 1865 , thousands flocked into Washington to view the coffin , further raising the profile of the city . 

The new president Andrew Johnson wanted to dispel the funereal atmosphere , and organised a programme of victory parades which revived public hopes for the future .
