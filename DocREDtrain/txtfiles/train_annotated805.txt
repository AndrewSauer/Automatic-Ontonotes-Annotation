Erasmus Hendjala ( born 31 December 1947 in Omundudu , Ohangwena Region ) is a Namibian politician . 

Hendjala represented the Hakahana constituency and later Tobias Hainyeko constituency in Katutura , Windhoek , Khomas Region as a member of the ruling South West Africa People 's Organization ( SWAPO ) from 1993 until August 2008 . 

In 2008 , Hendjala was abruptly expelled via letter for " serious misconduct and violation of the SWAPO constitution " . 

A month later , Hendjala joined the Rally for Democracy and Progress and announced he would contest the regional by - election in October 2008 , which was forced by his expulsion from SWAPO . 

However , three opposition parties including Hendjala 's RDP withdrew prior to the election , ensuring an easy SWAPO victory . 

His wife , a member of the SWAPO women 's council , did not leave SWAPO with her husband .
