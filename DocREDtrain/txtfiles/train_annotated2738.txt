The Ringbahn ( German for Circular Railway ) is a long railway line of the Berlin S - Bahn network in Germany , around the city centre . 

The circle route is made up of the double tracked S - Bahn ring and the parallel freight ring . 

S - Bahn service on the line is provided by lines S 41 ( clockwise ) and S 42 ( anticlockwise ) , carrying 400,000 passengers a day . 

Due to its distinctive shape , the line is often referred to as Hundekopf ( Dog 's Head ) . 

The Ring is structured by the east - west railway thoroughfare called the Stadtbahn ( city railway ) , crossing the Ring in the west at Westkreuz and in the east at Ostkreuz ( Eastern Crossing ) into a Südring ( Southern Ring ) and a Nordring ( Northern Ring ) , and by the north - south S - Bahn link ( with the North - South S - Bahn - tunnel as its central part ) crossing at Gesundbrunnen station in the north and both Schöneberg station and Südkreuz in the south into a Westring ( Western Ring ) and an Ostring ( Eastern Ring ) . 

These four sections served as tariff zones of the railway Berlin suburban fare structure before the previous world war . 

Today , the Ringbahn is the boundary of the " A " zone in the Verkehrsverbund Berlin - Brandenburg transport association 's fare structure , and the road traffic control zone for the low emissions established on 1 January 2008 .
