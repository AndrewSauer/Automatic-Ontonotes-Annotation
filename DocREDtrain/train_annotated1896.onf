Oliver Wendell Holmes describes him thus , in his study of Ralph Waldo Emerson : " His ' shining morning face ' was round as a baby 's , and talked as pleasantly as his voice did , with smiles for accents and dimples for punctuation ... It was of him that the story was always told , -- it may be as old as the invention of printing , -- that he threw his sermons into a barrel , where they went to pieces and got mixed up , and that when he was going to preach he fished out what he thought would be about enough for a sermon , and patched the leaves together as he best might .
