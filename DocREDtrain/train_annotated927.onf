His compositional activity , as shown in the essay Backstage of the creative act , the music psychologist Rosa Alba Gambino , can be divided into two phases : the first ( which ends with the composition of the holy La sposa del vento for soloists , chorus and orchestra staged in Palermo in 2000 by Operalaboratorio ) in which Andrea Ferrante investigates the Mediterranean sounds of his land through the filter of the contemporary , and the second ( after ten years of silence , and in collaboration with his favourite pianist Domenico Piccichè ) in which the mature composer 's own language is inspired by multiculturalism and the concept of emotion / enjoyment of music that cast its production outside Europe .
